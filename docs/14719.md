# 祝贺脆饼干赢家！GitHub 赢得最佳整体启动

就这样，第六届嘎吱嘎吱年度颁奖典礼就要到了。当 TechCrunch、GigaOm 和 Venture Beat 联合向最优秀和最聪明的初创公司、创始人和风险资本家颁发 20 个奖项时，约翰·奥利弗提供了一个欢笑之夜。

夜晚以一点科学开始，火星好奇号获得了最佳技术成就大奖。然后，Snapchat，一个每个青少年的智能手机上必不可少的小应用，赢得了“最快崛起的初创公司”。蒂姆·阿姆斯特朗和迈克尔·阿灵顿满脸笑容地递给马克·扎克伯格年度首席执行官克朗彻。正如创业界可以证明的那样，克里斯·迪克森理所当然地获得了年度最佳天使奖，而彼得·泰尔获得了年度最佳风险投资奖。

祝贺所有[冠军](https://web.archive.org/web/20230406200338/https://techcrunch.com/events/crunchies-2012/winners/)——迈向 2013 年！
