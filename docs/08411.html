<p class="translated">今天，库比蒂诺<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230308065421/http://www.cupertino.org/index.aspx?page=1107">在城市网站上发布了关于该项目的更详细的计划。该项目被称为该市的“苹果校园2”，将建在280号高速公路附近的175英亩土地上。总建筑面积约为280万平方英尺，将设有一个1000座的礼堂(除了苹果最大的活动之外，所有活动都很完美)、一个健身中心、30万平方英尺的研究设施、一个发电厂和地下停车场。但所有这些听起来都很无聊，你真正需要看到的是它看起来的样子:一个巨大的飞碟状环路。幸运的是，Cupertino包括了苹果的提案文件，其中包括许多该项目的新渲染图。</a></p>
<p class="translated">库比蒂诺说，他们仍然必须审查该项目的环境影响，并在实际批准之前举行更多的公众听证会。但是，是的，再一次，这是不可能的。苹果的计划是明年破土动工，2015年建成新总部。它将在一个巨大的建筑中容纳超过12，000名员工。</p>
<p class="translated">下面找到一些新的渲染图和完整的建议，通过9to5 Mac 嵌入在<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230308065421/http://9to5mac.com/2011/08/12/cupertino-releases-detailed-drawings-of-mothership-applehq-building/">下面。</a></p>
