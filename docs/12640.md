今晚，硅谷的英雄们放下竞争，聚集在第三届年度 [TechFellow Awards](https://web.archive.org/web/20230223222529/http://techfellows.com/) 上庆祝创新精神。一个由行业巨头组成的[全明星委员会](https://web.archive.org/web/20230223222529/https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/founders-fund-techfellow-awards/)仔细考虑了你提名的工程、产品设计和营销、综合管理和颠覆性创新领域的远见卓识者。他们在每个类别中选择了 5 名领导者，并授予他们每人 10 万美元的奖金，用于投资他们选择的创业公司。

在[创始人基金](https://web.archive.org/web/20230223222529/http://www.foundersfund.com/)、TechCrunch 和[新企业协会(NEA)](https://web.archive.org/web/20230223222529/http://www.nea.com/) 的支持下，颁奖典礼在三藩市现代艺术博物馆举行，由吉姆·帕森斯主持，他是艾美奖奖得主，出演了乏味的电视喜剧节目《生活大爆炸》。市长埃德·李发表了讲话，脸书工程师马克·斯利担任 DJ，过去的获奖者为我们行业的未来干杯。
