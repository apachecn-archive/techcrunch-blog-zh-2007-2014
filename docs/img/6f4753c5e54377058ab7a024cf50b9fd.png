Avoid taking away or deflecting someone\\u2019s grief to give yourself focus, or trying to compare a loss you\\u2019ve experienced to someone else\\u2019s.<\\/p><p>Everyone\\u2019s grieving process is unique and it\\u2019s incredibly important that the bereaved doesn\\u2019t feel like what they\\u2019re feeling is wrong or that they should suppress their emotions. Try not to give advice such as \\u2018stay strong\\u2019, and \\u2018you\\u2019ll get past this\\u2019 as it can seem like you\\u2019re ignoring their feelings and the complex emotions they\\u2019re experiencing. <\\/p><p>Also entirely avoid apportioning blame or mentioning the circumstances of someone\\u2019s passing. In almost all cases the memory of someone\\u2019s passing will be harrowing and the bereaved won\\u2019t want to be reminded of such a situation. <\\/p><p>Finally, where you\\u2019re unsure of someone\\u2019s religious beliefs or unsure of how best to express your condolences appropriate to someone\\u2019s religion \\u2013 just avoid mentioning it entirely. Especially where your beliefs don\\u2019t align with the deceased or their family, avoid injecting religiously-oriented messages. An atheist might take offence to bible passages being quoted to them, for instance.<\\/p><p>Some phrases you should steer away from include;<\\/p><ul><li>It\\u2019ll get easier in time\\u2026<\\/li><li>These things happen for a reason\\u2026<\\/li><li>____ is in a better place now\\u2026<\\/li><li>I know how you feel\\u2026<\\/li><li>You\\u2019ll meet someone else\\u2026 \\/ You\\u2019ll fall in love again\\u2026<\\/li><li>It\\u2019s time to move on\\u2026<\\/li><li>You can still fall pregnant again\\u2026.<\\/li><li>Things could be worse\\u2026<br><\\/li><\\/ul>","cta":"\\/occasion\\/sympathy","ctaLabel":"Explore Sympathy Cards","featureImageUrls":null,"items":[],"subtitle":null,"quote":null,"featureImage":null},{"type":"quote","title":"Signing Off Your Condolence Message","content":"<p>How you sign off depends on how close you are to the recipient, however as with choosing how to address your card \\u2013 it\\u2019s best to keep it simple and somewhat formal.
