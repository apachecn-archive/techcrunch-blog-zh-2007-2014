The data contained all the information that a criminal would need to make fraudulent transactions and purchases using a cardholder&#8217;s information.<\/p>\n<p>The credit card numbers belong to customers who made purchases through a network of near-identical online stores claiming to sell designer goods and apparel. But the stores had the same security problem in common: Any time a customer made a purchase, their credit card data and billing information was saved in a database, which was left exposed to the internet without a password. Anyone who knew the IP address of the database could access reams of unencrypted financial data.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hak1mlukha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anurag Sen<\/a>, a good-faith security researcher, found the exposed credit card records and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to its owner. Sen has a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/19\/oracle-bluekai-web-tracking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respectable<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/27\/amazon-prime-video-server-exposed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">track<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/justalk-spilled-millions-of-user-messages-and-locations-for-months\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record<\/a> of scanning the internet looking for exposed servers and inadvertently published data, and reporting it to companies to get their systems secured.<\/p>\n<p>But in this case, Sen wasn&#8217;t the first person to discover the spilling data. According to a ransom note left behind on the exposed database, someone else had found the spilling data and, instead of trying to identify the owner and responsibly reporting the spill, the unnamed person instead claimed to have taken a copy of the entire database&#8217;s contents of credit card data and would return it in exchange for a small sum of cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>A review of the data by TechCrunch shows most of the credit card numbers are owned by cardholders in the United States. Several people we contacted confirmed that their exposed credit card data was accurate.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has identified several online stores whose customers&#8217; information was exposed by the leaky database. Many of the stores claim to operate out of Hong Kong. Some of the stores are designed to sound similar to big-name brands, like Sprayground, but whose websites have no discernible contact information, typos and spelling mistakes, and a conspicuous lack of customer reviews. Internet records also show the websites were set up in the past few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these websites include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<pre>spraygroundusa.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>ihuahebuy.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>igoodlinks.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>ibuysbuy.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>lichengshop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>hzoushop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>goldlyshop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>haohangshop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>twinklebubble.store<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>spendidbuy.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you bought something from one of those sites in the past few weeks, you might want to consider your banking card compromised and contact your bank or card provider.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear who is responsible for this network of knockoff stores. TechCrunch contacted a person via WhatsApp whose Singapore-registered phone number was listed as the point of contact on several of the online stores. It&#8217;s not clear if the contact number listed is even involved with the stores, given one of the websites listed its location as a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Houston, Texas.<\/p>\n<p>Internet records showed that the database was operated by a customer of Tencent, whose cloud services were used to host the database. TechCrunch contacted Tencent about its customer&#8217;s database leaking credit card information, and the company responded quickly. The customer&#8217;s database went offline a short time later.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we learned of the incident, we immediately contacted the customer who operates the database and it was shut down immediately. Data privacy and security are top priorities at Tencent. We will continue to work with our customers to ensure they maintain their databases in a safe and secure manner,&#8221; said Carrie Fan, global communications director at Tencent.<\/p>\n<p><b>Read more:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/22\/paay-unencrypted-credit-card-data\/\">New York payments startup exposed millions of credit cards<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/20\/moviepass-thousands-data-exposed-leak\/\">MoviePass exposed thousands of unencrypted customer card numbers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/01\/wiseasy-android-payment-passwords\/\">Hackers stole passwords for accessing 140,000 payment terminals<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you recently made a purchase from an overseas online store selling knockoff clothes and goods, there&#8217;s a chance your credit card number and personal information were exposed.

reports $24.3B revenue in the fourth quarter, beating Street estimates"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Tesla just beat Wall Street revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of 2022. The company closed out Q4 with $24.3 billion in revenue, a 37% increase from the same quarter last year and a 13% bump quarter-over-quarter. Analysts had expected the company to earn around $24.2 billion, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/TSLA\/analysis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yahoo Finance data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The electric vehicle maker had $1.4 billion in free cash flow at the end of Q4, which is down from the $3.3 billion the company had in the bank at the end of the third quarter.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s stock saw a 3.2% spike to $149 per share immediately after earnings dropped and continued to rise to $151.52 in after-hours trading.<\/p>\n<h2>The effect of price cuts on margins<\/h2>\n<p>Investors today were on the lookout for gross margins after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/13\/tesla-keeps-slashing-prices-this-time-by-as-much-as-20\/\">Tesla slashed prices<\/a> and offered <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/01\/tesla-offers-3750-discount-for-model-3-model-y-deliveries-in-december\/\">multiple discounts<\/a> on its vehicles. While Tesla as a whole closed the quarter with a 16% operating margin, automotive gross margins came in at 25.9%, which is the lowest figure in the last five quarters.<\/p>\n<p>Margins in the first quarter of 2023 might look worse, says Eric Schiffer, the CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;The outlook will still depend on the recent moves of Q1, which suggest some compression in demand,&#8221; Schiffer told TechCrunch, referring to January&#8217;s price cuts.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla acknowledged that short-term automotive margins will be impacted by the decrease in prices and the general inflationary environment, but the company&#8217;s management is more focused on its operating margin.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;As other areas of the business become more important, and particularly the energy business which is growing faster than the vehicle business, we&#8217;re heavily focused on operating leverage here and improving the efficiency of our overheads,&#8221; said Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla&#8217;s chief financial officer, during Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Elon Musk wanted to put concerns around demand to bed during the call, saying that after the company brought down prices, January saw the strongest demand ever in Tesla&#8217;s history. In fact, he said, demand exceeds production.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 405,278 in the fourth quarter. While those were record deliveries, the automaker still <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/02\/tesla-delivers-405278-vehicles-in-q4-missing-wall-street-expectations\/\">missed Wall Street estimates<\/a> for the third quarter in a row. Similarly, Tesla&#8217;s 1.3 million vehicle deliveries in 2022 was also a record for the automaker, but that number misses Tesla&#8217;s own guidance of achieving 50% growth YoY and getting to 1.4 million deliveries.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, Tesla still intends to grow production as quickly as possible &#8220;in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021,&#8221; and reach 1.8 million cars in 2023. During Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call, Musk said Tesla has the potential to reach 2 million cars this year but is being cautious given market uncertainty.<\/p>\n<h2>Prioritizing &#8220;affordability&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>The company acknowledged that average sales prices have &#8220;generally been on a downward trajectory for many years,&#8221; and that Tesla aims to prioritize &#8220;affordability&#8221; so that it can grow into a company that sells multiple millions of cars annually.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Price really matters,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;The vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car, can&#8217;t afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Musk went on to say that Tesla is working on cost control measures like factory efficiencies, which will manifest this year in the ramp of production at the new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin, better control of the supply chain and even design changes, specifically to the powertrain.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla also announced earlier this week <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/24\/tesla-invests-3-6b-in-two-new-nevada-factories-to-build-semis-and-cells\/\">plans to invest an additional $3.6 billion<\/a> into its Nevada gigafactory to build a battery cell facility and a Semi truck factory. In terms of battery cells, the company&#8217;s long-term goal is to get &#8220;well in excess of 1000 gigawatt hours of cells produced internally,&#8221; said Musk, noting that the company would also rely on third-party battery cell producers like Panasonic to keep costs down and efficiency up. Musk also nodded to Tesla&#8217;s plan to make a 4680 cell that will have low-cost and high-energy density.<\/p>\n<p>The EV tax incentives for vehicles produced in the U.S. and with battery components sourced from U.S. or free trade agreement countries might also help Tesla bring its prices down, said Kirkhorn.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are on our products going forward,&#8221; said Kirkhorn.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing costs of the vehicles down will also be a necessity for the automaker as it, along with everyone else, faces macroeconomic pressures, a looming recession and increasing competition from other automakers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Tesla is not immune [to] the recession, and I still expect to see more recession-driven market pain,&#8221; said Schiffer.<\/p>\n<h2>Autonomy, electrification and energy solutions<\/h2>\n<p>Tesla said it remains focused on &#8220;autonomy, electrification and energy solutions.&#8221; The company&#8217;s energy storage arm finished out 2022 with the &#8220;highest level&#8221; of deployments ever. Energy storage deployments increased 152% from Q4 in 2021 to 2.5 GWh, for a total 2022 deployment of 6.5 GWh. Tesla said demand for its storage products &#8220;remains in excess of [its] ability to supply.&#8221; The company said it is ramping up production at its 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California, to address demand.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s solar deployments also increased 18% YoY in Q4 to 100 MW, with a total 348 MW of solar deployed in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system, Tesla said it had sold its beta version of the software to roughly 400,000 customers, bringing in revenue recognition of $324 million as part of the company&#8217;s automotive sales.<\/p>\n<h2>On Elon tweeting<\/h2>\n<p>One investor asked Musk if his constant stream of consciousness on Twitter might cause the Tesla brand to lose popularity and cause division among customers, thus impacting demand. Musk brushed this concern aside, pulling up his Twitter account to demonstrate his 127 million followers, which &#8220;suggests that I&#8217;m, you know, reasonably popular.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;The net value of Twitter, apart from a few people complaining, is gigantic. Obviously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Cybertruck production to ramp in 2024<\/h2>\n<p>Musk also addressed the long-delayed Cybertruck, a vehicle he said he will definitely be driving once it comes off the assembly lines.<\/p>\n<p>The CEO confirmed that start of production for the truck will likely still happen this summer, but SOP is slow, he said. Volume production is when things really get going, and that is scheduled for next year.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla said it has begun installation on the production equipment for the Cybertruck in Texas and has built all of its beta vehicles, with more coming in the next month.<\/p>\n<p>The company will share more details about its upcoming plans across the board at its investor day on March 1.<\/p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Eric Schiffer was a Tesla investor, and he is not.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JTPsHgKoT7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/25\/tesla-energy-storage-q4-2022-earnings\/\">Tesla&#8217;s energy storage arm caps 2022 with &#8216;highest level&#8217; of deployments ever<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tesla&#8217;s energy storage arm caps 2022 with &#8216;highest level&#8217; of deployments ever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/25\/tesla-energy-storage-q4-2022-earnings\/embed\/#?secret=MGHlGmpeVQ#?secret=JTPsHgKoT7\" data-secret=\"JTPsHgKoT7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tesla just beat Wall Street revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of 2022.

As the name implies, the team is using the event to showcase up-and-coming features of the framework &#8212; most of which are still very early in their development cycle. The main highlights here are massively improved graphics performance, the ability to more easily embed Flutter code into existing web and mobile apps, and support for new architectures like Web Assembly and RISC-V. Virtually all of these capabilities still sit in canary branches and behind experiment flags, but they do show where Google plans to take this project in the months ahead &#8212; and help the overall open-source ecosystem around it understand where some complimentary work could be useful (about 40% of contributors to Flutter are outside of Google).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/timsneath\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tim Sneath<\/a>, Google&#8217;s director of product and UX for Flutter and the Dart programming language, told me that the team decided to completely rewrite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/flutter\/wiki\/Impeller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Impeller<\/a>, Flutter&#8217;s rendering runtime. This new version aims to fix some of the existing glitches of the previous engine but also greatly improves performance &#8212; all while still offering support for hot reloads and other core Flutter features.\u00a0 &#8220;It&#8217;s such a different sort of experience. It&#8217;s just so silky smooth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Essentially, we&#8217;re able to build a graphics rendering engine that&#8217;s tailored for Flutter rather than leveraging a general-purpose renderer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe title=\"Flutter Forward: Impeller side-by-side demo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Z7v-YRdHusM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>To enable this performance, the engine now features pre-compiled shaders, avoiding the frame drops of the previous engine during shader compilation. There&#8217;s also now support for custom shaders and pixel shaders, which enables a number of new effects &#8212; which in turn will enable developers to build a host of new experiences on top of Flutter. Underneath all of this sit the low-level Vulkan and Metal 3D graphics APIs of Android and iOS. Currently, the team is focusing its work here on mobile, though many of these new graphics capabilities should also work on macOS and Windows already. &#8220;Our general model for Flutter is take it everywhere you can paint pixels,&#8221; Sneath said.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about taking Flutter everywhere, another new feature the team is previewing is element embedding. For web developers, that means they can use this to easily embed Flutter content using a standard &lt;div&gt; element. While one could obviously write an entire application with Flutter and Dart, a lot of developers may want to integrate this new code into existing apps that may have been written in a different language.<\/p>\n<p>The team is also working on a new package that enables better JavaScript and Dart interoperability, as well as new tooling that will allow Flutter to more easily call system APIs on Android and iOS. It already had that ability before, but getting this to work involved writing a lot of boilerplate code for developers.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, the team is also launching its first efforts to compile Flutter to WebAssembly. With the hype around this binary format growing rapidly &#8212; and both browser support and server-side tooling maturing &#8212; it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that the Flutter team is also interested in this technology. For the most part, this is about getting additional performance from Flutter, Sneath explained. &#8220;Dart transpiles into very tightly compiled JavaScript code, but it&#8217;s still JavaScript code so it&#8217;ll be loaded and interpreted &#8212; and, for us, WebAssembly looks like it&#8217;s going to give us some improved time to load, reduce the size and number of megabytes transferred over the wire. That seems interesting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The potential for WebAssembly is &#8212; both on the web and even beyond &#8212; to become this new sort of portable lingua franca. I like the idea that we can take and use other code in other languages in WebAssembly as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2474573\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2474573\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2474573\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg\" alt=\"the RISC-V-based ClockworkPi DevTerm Kit\" width=\"1024\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=300,235 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=768,601 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=680,532 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=1200,939 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2474573\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The RISC-V-based ClockworkPi DevTerm Kit.<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As for RISC-V, the open standard royalty-free chip architecture that is also starting to get traction across the industry, Sneath noted that it is still very early days (though he said he really enjoyed playing with the RISC-V-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clockworkpi.com\/product-page\/devterm-kit-r01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ClockworkPi DevTerm Kit<\/a>) but he believes supporting this architecture may open up new platforms for Flutter, especially in the embedded space. With Google&#8217;s Android team also investing in this architecture, it&#8217;s definitely worth keeping an eye on what Google is doing here, even as the number of developers who are specifically targeting this architecture is surely still quite low.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the Flutter team is also launching an interesting new toolkit for news publishers, which builds on the success of a similar initiative the team launched for game developers at Google&#8217;s I\/O developer conference last year. This toolkit should enable new publishers to quickly build a new-centric mobile app with support fo authentication, ad integrations, notifications and more &#8212; all without having to design these elements from scratch.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe title=\"FOO041 v8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YnJwjZ3jCTc?start=4&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Flutter, Google&#8217;s open-source framework for building multi-platform apps for mobile, web and desktop, is hosting its Flutter Forward event in Nairobi, Kenya today.

profitability.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that in turbulent times, startups and scaleups alike need to ensure:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They have sufficient runway to ride out a downturn without relying on large amounts of external funding.<\/li>\n<li>They are developing fundamentally healthy businesses with attractive economics and a cost structure built for efficient growth.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>While every company is unique and it\u2019s difficult to create a blueprint for must-track metrics across stages and business models, we\u2019ve found three metrics that provide helpful green, yellow and red

on burning cash. It makes sense to, because building and scaling an organization requires meaningful investment, often before a company can generate enough revenue to pay the bills. The key is to ensure that burn is prudent and efficient.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tOne way to analyze whether progress toward profitability looks healthy is to analyze incremental profit margin from one period to the next.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>In general, if you are earning net new ARR of $1 for each dollar spent, you are in a strong position \u2014 your net new ARR to burn ratio is 1, which is healthy relative to benchmarks. A ratio greater than 1.5x is best-in-class, and if it&#8217;s below 0.6x, a closer look may be warranted.<\/p>\n<p>We view cash burn efficiency as an effective shorthand metric to keep an eye on. If you need to spend more than $2 to generate revenue of $1, it may be a signal that growth is being \u201cforced\u201d and is therefore unsustainable.<\/p>\n<h2>Incremental profit margin<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2473906\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2473906\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2473906\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png 1800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=150,125 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=300,250 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=768,640 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=680,567 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=1536,1280 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=1200,1000 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2.png?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2473906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Paris Heymann<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Profitability is often discussed in absolute terms, but it\u2019s important to remember that companies typically progress toward profitability over time.

\u2014 formerly LogMeIn \u2014 has confirmed that cybercriminals stole customers\u2019 encrypted backups during a recent breach of its systems.<\/p>\n<p>The breach was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/30\/lastpass-goto-breached-customer-information\/\">first confirmed by LastPass<\/a> on November 30. At the time, LastPass chief executive Karim Toubba said an \u201cunauthorized party\u201d had gained access to some customers\u2019 information stored in a third-party cloud service shared by LastPass and GoTo. The attackers used information stolen from an earlier breach of LastPass systems in August to further compromise the companies&#8217; shared cloud data. GoTo, which bought LastPass in 2015, said at the time that it was investigating the incident.<\/p>\n<p>Now, almost two months later, GoTo said in an updated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goto.com\/blog\/our-response-to-a-recent-security-incident\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement<\/a> that the cyberattack impacted several of its products, including business communications tool Central; online meetings service Join.me; hosted VPN service Hamachi, and its Remotely Anywhere remote access tool.<\/p>\n<p>GoTo said the intruders exfiltrated customers&#8217; encrypted backups from these services \u2014 as well as the company&#8217;s encryption key for securing the data.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe affected information, which varies by product, may include account usernames, salted and hashed passwords, a portion of multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings, as well as some product settings and licensing information,\u201d said GoTo CEO Paddy Srinivasan. \u201cIn addition, while Rescue and GoToMyPC encrypted databases were not exfiltrated, MFA settings of a small subset of their customers were impacted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite the delay, GoTo provided no remediation guidance or advice for affected customers.<\/p>\n<p>GoTo\u00a0said the company does not store customers\u2019 credit card or bank details, or collect personal information, such as date of birth, home address, or Social Security numbers.\u00a0That&#8217;s in sharp contrast to the hack affecting <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/22\/lastpass-customer-password-vaults-stolen\/\">its subsidiary, LastPass<\/a>, during which attackers stole the contents of customers&#8217; encrypted password vaults, along with customers\u2019 names, email addresses, phone numbers, and some billing information.<\/p>\n<p>GoTo did not say how many customers are affected. The company has 800,000 customers, including enterprises, according to GoTo public relations director Jen Mathews, who declined to answer our other questions. GoTo spokesperson Nikolett Bacso-Albaum also repeatedly declined to comment or respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions when reached prior to publication.<\/p>\n<p>Srinivasan says GoTo is contacting affected customers directly and is advising those impacted to reset passwords and reauthorize MFA settings &#8220;out of an abundance of caution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>January 24: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of GoTo customers.

However, Tado and its SPAC partner <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/press-releases\/2022-03-09\/dgap-adhoc-gfj-esg-acquisition-i-se-and-tado-gmbh-adjust-enterprise-value-of-tado-gmbh-for-envisaged-business-combination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revealed in March<\/a> that they were &#8220;adjusting&#8221; the enterprise value to around \u20ac400 million ($436 million) due to &#8220;current market volatility,&#8221; before the deal finally went the way of the dodo six months later.<\/p>\n<p>Little more was revealed about the reasons behind this, though it was reasonable to assume that with tech valuations plummeting and economic headwinds driving major <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/22\/with-new-cuts-klarna-joins-the-ranks-of-companies-having-to-conduct-more-than-one-layoff\/\">downsizing efforts<\/a> across just about every sector, Tado and GFJ ESG Acquisition simply got cold feet due to the timing of it all.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We decided to end ongoing discussions related to a deSPAC with <em>GFJ ESG Acquisition I SE<\/em> due to current public capital market conditions,&#8221; Tado&#8217;s chief product officer Christian Deilmann explained to TechCrunch. &#8220;We value and appreciate our partnership with GFJ ESG, and share similar goals towards building a more sustainable future for Europe and the world.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so Tado has instead chosen to double down on its recent growth, which in 2022 it claims saw it pass 3 million smart thermostats sold since its beginnings. With a fresh $46.9 million in the bank, the Munich-based company said that it&#8217;s looking to scale its business in two ways &#8212; one of which involves appealing to customers looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2022\/sep\/01\/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">counter rising energy costs<\/a> through combining so-called &#8220;time-of-use&#8221; energy tariffs with its smart thermostat products.<\/p>\n<p>Time-of-use tariffs essentially encourage users to use electricity at specific times when it&#8217;s cheaper, and Tado <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tado.com\/gb-en\/press-releases\/awattar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquired a company called Awattar<\/a> last year that provides power load-shifting through such tariffs<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will double down on helping our customers to reduce heating expenses,&#8221; <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Deilmann said.<\/span> &#8220;So far, our focus was on reducing energy demand, now with our smart energy tariffs we also help to reduce the cost of energy. With a smart energy tariff, special heat pumps are controlled in a way that they avoid running during hours of a day in which energy prices are high. Everything happens automatically in the background while always maintaining a perfect room climate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Tado said that it&#8217;s planning to work with real estate companies that manage rental properties, which could help Tado scale.<\/p>\n<h2>Emergency exit<\/h2>\n<p>While it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/18\/microsoft-announces-10000-job-cuts-nearly-5-of-its-workforce\/\">impossible to ignore<\/a> the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/20\/google-parent-alphabet-cuts-6-of-its-workforce-impacting-12000-people\/\">widespread layoffs<\/a> that have permeated the technology industry <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/05\/amazon-to-cut-18000-jobs-as-tech-layoffs-continue\/\">for the past year<\/a>, Tado said that it has so far not had to downsize in anyway, and doesn&#8217;t expect to do so.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We currently have 200 employees at Tado, with the majority of employees based in our Munich headquarters,&#8221; <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Deilmann said, adding that it also has remote workers in the U.K. and Austria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>However, all this leaves one lingering question. As a 12 year old company with around $200 million in funding, some sort of exit seems a little overdue &#8212; its <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/financialtimes\/status\/1394344543076691970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previous round of funding in 2021<\/a> was intended to be its final raise before it explored a sale or public listing. So can we expect an IPO &#8212; SPAC or otherwise &#8212; in the future?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whilst we do want to consider the public listing of Tado in the future, we have no updates in this regard, whether publicly listing ourselves, or via a SPAC,&#8221; <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Deilmann said.<\/span> &#8220;Our current focus is to continue our strong growth track of doubling business on a yearly basis, while turning profitable in 2023.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to lead investor Trill Impact Ventures, Tado&#8217;s latest round of funding included participation from <a href=\"https:\/\/bayernkapital.de\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bayern Kapital<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/kiko.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kiko Ventures<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swisscanto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swisscanto<\/a> (Z\u00fcrcher Kantonalbank).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smart home energy startup Tado has raised \u20ac43 million ($46.9 million) in a round of funding led by Trill Impact Ventures, as the company pursues plans to become profitable in 2023.

Last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/11\/choco-unicorn-food-waste-supply-chain\/\">Choco hit the much-coveted unicorn status<\/a> for software that digitizes the ordering, supply chain and communications processes for suppliers and restaurants. Elsewhere, there are companies serving <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/21\/freshflow-seed\/\">AI-powered forecasting smarts<\/a> to help retailers optimize their stock replenishment, while others have built marketplaces <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/17\/full-harvest-imperfect-produce-food-waste\/\">for selling surplus or imperfect produce<\/a>. There&#8217;s even a company setting out to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/03\/alterpacks\/\">transform food waste into food containers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another fledgling startup called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kanpla.dk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kanpla<\/a>, meanwhile, is focusing its efforts on cutting food waste in one very specific vertical: canteens.<\/p>\n<p>Founded out of Denmark in 2019, Kanpla initially targeted school canteens, serving up software for parents to pre-order food for their kids (children under the age of 13 are not allowed a debit card in Denmark) which gave schools a good idea of how much and what kinds of food to prepare. Today, the company targets all manner of canteens, with paying customers including shipping giant Maersk and Danish brewer Carlsberg, as well as industrial canteen providers such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coor<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/cheval-blanc.dk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cheval Blanc<\/a> which serve more than 230 canteens across the Nordics.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In 2022, Kanpla said that its software was used in some 1,500 canteens, and it expects to triple that number this year as it expands into more European markets. In preparation for this growth, the company today announced it has raised \u20ac2.2 million ($2.4 million) in a seed round of funding.<\/p>\n<h2>How it works<\/h2>\n<p>There are two core elements to the Kanpla platform. For kitchens, Kanpla offers what it calls an &#8220;operating system&#8221; for managing their whole canteen from a PC or mobile device, including creating digital menus, support for different payment types, collecting and presenting sales data, and more. Through this, companies can understand what food sells best, allowing them to stock up on the right kinds of ingredients thereby minimizing produce that might otherwise go to waste.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2474546\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2474546\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2474546\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png\" alt=\"Kanpla canteen stats\" width=\"800\" height=\"618\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png?resize=150,116 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png?resize=300,232 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png?resize=768,593 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png?resize=680,525 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/63bbbb31c0213a5f4973dddd_en-travl-kok-hero-p-800-e1674584768461.png?resize=50,39 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2474546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kanpla canteen stats <strong>Image Credits<\/strong>: Kanpla<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the &#8220;diner&#8221; side, users can access a mobile or web app for perusing menus and ordering food, meaning that their food can be waiting for them when they arrive in the canteen.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2474549\" style=\"width: 998px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2474549\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2474549\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"988\" height=\"691\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png 988w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png?resize=150,105 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png?resize=300,210 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png?resize=768,537 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png?resize=680,476 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Kanplamenu-e1674584867970.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2474549\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kanpla for canteen diners <strong>Image Credits<\/strong>: Kanpla<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On top of that, the Kanpla platform has features specifically for addressing food waste.<\/p>\n<p>For example, it enables kitchens and canteens to sell surplus food from their lunch or buffet menus as takeaways to guests.

We thought about how we spent half of our lunch-break waiting in lines. These inconveniences led us to dive into the pains, finding an industry that was heavily behind on digitalization, with additional problems of forecasting, limited tools to manage guest relations, and a high degree of manual work for print and billing. These insights became the beginning of our journey to digitalize this industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While canteens undoubtedly share many of the pain points of other eating establishments, each come with their own unique problems and opportunities that require a different approach from a technology standpoint.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Canteens differentiate from cafes and restaurants by having recurring guests, coming back day after day, giving them a unique potential to connect with their guests&#8221; B\u00e6ch continued. &#8220;Additionally, they have the added complexity and issues due to menus switching daily, and payments working often through hybrid approaches that may include card, invoice, and salary deduction.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kanpla&#8217;s seed round was led by Netherlands-based VC <a href=\"https:\/\/henq.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HenQ<\/a>, with participation from a handful of angel investors. The company said it will use its fresh cash injection to expand beyond its native Denmark and into the U.K., Norway and The Netherlands in 2023, with plans to extend its reach into the U.S. and other European markets the following year.<\/p>\n<p>Denmark has spawned a number of sizeable tech companies through the years, such as expense management software provider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pleo.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pleo<\/a> which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/08\/pleo-picks-up-200m-at-a-4-7b-valuation-to-build-the-next-generation-of-business-expense-management\/\">hit a $4.7 billion valuation a year ago<\/a>, while local neobank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lunar.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lunar<\/a> achieved a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/10\/lunar-the-nordic-neo-bank-raises-77m-at-a-2b-valuation-and-launches-crypto-trading-platform-and-b2b-payments\/\">valuation north of $2 billion last year<\/a>. And then there is, of course, <a href=\"http:\/\/zendesk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zendesk<\/a> which was bought out by a private equity firm for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/24\/zendesk-drama-concludes-with-10-2-billion-private-equity-acquisition\/\">$10 billion back in June<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>HenQ partner Jan Andriessen reckons that Kanpla can blaze a similar trail to Zendesk by cashing in on what initially seems like a niche vertical.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At first, the canteen industry can seem obscure, but it\u2019s a big market with huge potential,&#8221; Andriessen said in a statement. &#8220;Many B2B software products have blossomed in seemingly non-obvious markets. Zendesk, one of Denmark\u2019s greatest tech businesses, was founded well before customer success software became a well-defined term. Kanpla can be the same, and that\u2019s what makes them the type of B2B business we\u2019re excited to support.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As much as 40% of all food produced each year goes nowhere near a human mouth, resulting in economic, environmental, and social costs of an estimated $2.6 trillion.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/29\/angry-miao-cyberblade\/\">earbuds<\/a>). The company&#8217;s previous releases, The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.angrymiao.com\/cyberboard-terminal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cyberboard<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/this-keyboard-is-something-else\/\">Am Hatsu<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.angrymiao.com\/am-afa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Am AFA<\/a>, are as overengineered as they are unique. When the company first started teasing its new 60% board, it almost looked too conventional to be an Angry Miao product, but keeping with tradition, there&#8217;s a twist here.<\/p>\n<p>See, the AM 65 Less: AM Compact Touch is a wired and Bluetooth-enabled 60% keyboard with an <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@imsurajyadav\/hhkb-layout-keyboards-in-depth-explanation-e082725a2662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HHKB layout<\/a> &#8212; which means there are no function keys, no numpad and, as is standard for this layout, no arrow keys. Typically, keyboard enthusiasts then put those arrow keys on a separate layer, accessed through a key combo. As you can imagine, that can be a bit of a hassle, especially if you write a lot. But having their hearts set on this layout, the Angry Miao designers decided that instead of keyboard shortcuts, they could put a small touch panel on the front of the case. The argument here is that this offers the advantages of a small 60% keyboard and symmetric HHKB layout, while still featuring arrow key functions. Did I mention Angry Miao really likes to overengineer its products?<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2475271\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2475271\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2475271\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg 3930w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=768,573 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=680,508 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=1536,1147 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=2048,1529 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=1200,896 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230103_194113195.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2475271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Originally, the company had called the board the &#8216;AM 65 Less,&#8217; but that caused a bit of confusion in the community, given that it&#8217;s not really a 65% keyboard either. The official name is now the AM 65 Less: Am Compact Touch.<\/p>\n<p>Angry Miao sent me a review unit in the Famicon-inspired &#8216;8-Bit&#8217; colorway last month (there are seven variants in total) and I&#8217;ve been using it almost exclusively ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the touch panel, this is the company&#8217;s most conventional keyboard yet. It features a hotswap PCB, so you can easily change the switches if you want to, south-facing RGB lighting, and with the exception of the high front, it looks pretty normal for a small keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2475356\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2475356\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2475356\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg 4080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_192606793_2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2475356\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the touch panel first, since it&#8217;s surely the most controversial aspect of the board. It works just as described and it does what it does well, but arrow keys remain infinitely more convenient. The promise here is that you won&#8217;t have to move your wrists as much because your thumbs can handle moving the cursor, since it&#8217;s already aligned with the touchpad. In reality, you&#8217;re likely going to move your hands more, because you&#8217;ll use your mouse more. For fixing the kinds of typos you catch while writing a word, it&#8217;s easy enough to go back a few letters. For anything more, which you can do by keeping your finger on the touchpad, it becomes a bit of a guessing game whether you&#8217;ll be able to time things right to stop the cursor where you need to. I ended up putting the cursor keys on a layer, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the touchpad, of course. Your mileage may vary.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe title=\"AM New Layout: Touch Panel Hands-on\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/j_vi9ULtdT8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The fact that the touchpad is at the front of the board also means you can&#8217;t really use a wrist wrest, something that&#8217;s exasperated by the fact that the board sits at a non-changeable 10-degree angle. I ended up putting a wrist rest a few inches away from the board, leaving enough space to still use the touchpad, though I never found the high angle to be a problem. The company recommends a split wrist wrest for users who want to use one.<\/p>\n<p>Like all Angry Miao products, this one is unapologetically not for everyone. The fact that it feels and sounds fantastic makes up for its quirks, but I can&#8217;t help but wonder what an Angry Miao 65% board with arrow keys would be like.<\/p>\n<p>One of Angry Miao&#8217;s latest innovations is its adjustable leaf spring that lets you change the flex of the PCT and hence the typing experience from very hard to soft. Currently, most other keyboards use a gasket design and very flexible PCBs to allow for a softer typing experience. If done right, that usually works, but in many of the keyboards I&#8217;ve recently tested, it didn&#8217;t seem to make all that much of a difference. Here, you can really feel the difference between the various settings (though it does take a bit of work to open up the board and make those changes to the springs).<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the different springs, the board also comes with all of the necessary tools to change them out, as well as a very nice screwdriver, an additional bottom foam mat, cleaning cloth, replacement cables and screws. There is no carrying case. Instead, Angry Miao opted for a soft carrying pouch.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe title=\"New AM Layout: 2-Stage Adjustable Leaf-spring\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ofgslWuEr0A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The build quality here is impeccable. The company says the CNC milling of the aluminum case alone takes almost 6 hours, with the case then being sandblasted and painted afterwards (with all of the colorways using two colors: one for the part of the case up to the top of the first row of keys and another for the rest). Mechanical keyboard fans are nothing if not persnickety, but I think they are going to have a hard time finding fault with the execution here, be it the rounded corners, the painting or even the finishing on the inside of the board.<\/p>\n<p>You open the board from the top, which is a bit unusual, but it also makes it pretty easy to take it apart. Once inside, there are a few more connectors than you are probably used to &#8212; in part because of the battery and Bluetooth module. It&#8217;s also easy to see why the board sounds good. Not only is there plenty of foam, but also a nice copper weight (the whole keyboard weighs in at about 3.3 pounds). Add the battery and the result is a board with very little room to sound hollow. There is also no rattle from the screw-in stabilizers.<\/p>\n<p>If you own one of Angry Miao&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.angrymiao.com\/cybermat-r2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cybermat<\/a> charging mats, you&#8217;ll be able to wirelessly charge the AM 65 Less with that, too.<\/p>\n<p>The switches that come with the bundle version are Angry Miao&#8217;s Icy Silver switches. These are premium transparent linear switches, manufactured by TTC, with dual-stage springs and an initial force of 45 grams. There&#8217;s very little stem wobble here and they are very smooth, though one thing worth noting is that as I took off the keycaps, the switches often came out of the PCB with them. That&#8217;s not been a problem in daily usage, but worth mentioning nonetheless.<\/p>\n<p>The result of all of this is a keyboard that is a joy to type on. Every key press sounds like two pool balls hitting each other, which is what I personally look for.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2475332\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png 1199w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_future.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Like all Angry Miao products, the 65 Less doesn&#8217;t come cheap, though while high, the price isn&#8217;t completely outrageous in the world of higher-end mechanical keyboards. The standard base kit, without switches and keycaps will retail for $398, the bundle with switches and keycaps that match the variant you choose will cost $498.<\/p>\n<p>Given that the likes of Keychron barely charge $20 more to go from a barebones kit to a fully assembled one, that&#8217;s quite a difference, but a lot of these are custom designs and the company sells its switches for about $1 each.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also talking about some thick, high-quality keycaps &#8212; at least on the 8-Bit version I tested. For this version, the company is using the Cherry-profile JTK Classic FC keycaps, inspired by the Nintendo Famicom of the 80s, which, best I can tell, were first available <a href=\"https:\/\/novelkeys.com\/products\/jtk-classic-fc-gb#:~:text=JTK%20Classic%20FC%20is%20heavily,is%20in%20gray%20and%20black.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a group buy<\/a> in 2020 and now available in stock at a number of vendors. These are triple-shot ABS keycaps with latin and hiragana legends that feature a mix of the original base kit and its novelties. Other variants feature keycaps the company created in collaboration with the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/domikey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domikey<\/a> and others.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2475335\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2475335\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2475335\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png 1107w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png?resize=300,199 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png?resize=768,509 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png?resize=680,451 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/angry_mech.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2475335\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Angry Miao<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While I haven&#8217;t tested these, there are also two special editions. For $450 for the base kit and $550 for the bundle, the Laser kit features LED light elements on the front left and right (inspired by Tesla&#8217;s Cybertruck, the company says). The Mech Love version, at $515 and $615, features <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IQkSsP_E4I8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customizable LED elements<\/a> in the open spaces next to the first row and personalizable engravings on the back. It looks like the company may later make these additional LED modules available as add-ons, too.<\/p>\n<p>Whether these boards are worth that is going to be in the eye of the beholder. The fact that Angry Miao is launching all of these variations must mean that the company believes it&#8217;ll see a fair number of orders. It&#8217;s definitely the company&#8217;s most approachable product yet and while the prices may seem eyewatering, they are within the ballgame for higher-end custom keyboards, where they keycaps themselves can often cost $150 or more. Like with so many &#8220;hobbies,&#8221; at some point, you are paying a lot more for incremental improvements. Whether you want to own a keyboard that costs as much as a laptop is something you have to decide for yourself. It&#8217;s definitely the closest we&#8217;ve seen Angry Miao come to building a straight-up everyday keyboard.<\/p>\n<p>The pre-launch for all of these variants will go <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/am-compact-touch-multi-flex-mechanical-keyboard\/coming_soon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live on Indiegogo on February 2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2475355\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2475355\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2475355\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg 4080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=300,226 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=768,578 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=680,512 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=1536,1157 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=2048,1542 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=1200,904 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/PXL_20230125_212617442.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2475355\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bonus<\/strong>: HyperX is launching its first artisan keycap today, <a href=\"https:\/\/hyperx.com\/products\/hyperx-3d-printed-keycap?variant=43198293082269\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coco the Cozy Cat<\/a>.

Walmart, which missed the e-commerce race in the U.S., has coughed up over $20 billion on Flipkart and PhonePe to buy the lion&#8217;s share in India&#8217;s e-commerce and payments markets.<\/p>\n<p>Flipkart leads the e-commerce market in India, according to Bernstein. And PhonePe commands over 40% of all transactions on UPI, a payments network in India built by a coalition of retail banks. UPI, which processes over 7 billion transactions a month, is the most popular way Indians pay online.<\/p>\n<p>As Walmart makes splashy moves, its rival is taking a different approach. Amazon <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">has spent the past few months streamlining its business in India. It has shut some of the newer bets &#8212; food delivery, wholesale distribution, and an attempt at online learning.

is a new home security service for the French market"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If you live in France and you want to add a security system to your home, you don\u2019t have a ton of options. You can contact a home security company like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verisure.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verisure<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homiris.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homiris<\/a>. But you\u2019ll end up paying expensive subscription fees with long-term contracts. You can also buy your own security camera and connected sensors. But, in that case, there won\u2019t be anyone monitoring your home for you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/qiara.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qiara<\/a> wants to modernize the good old home security market with live agents. The company wants to sell security products and subscriptions directly to end customers through its website without any long-term commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Users first choose the security products that they need from the company\u2019s own portfolio of products. Qiara sells a camera, a door sensor, a keypad, a siren and a motion sensor.<\/p>\n<p>After that, users can pay \u20ac29.99 per month for the service with live agents. If an alarm goes off, the monitoring agent tries to call you and checks the video feed from the security camera. If you don\u2019t answer the phone and there\u2019s something suspicious going on, the company will call the police for you. The company gives you a \u20ac10 discount on your subscription fee for the first year. There\u2019s also a cheaper subscription for customers who don\u2019t need 24\/7 monitoring \u2014 but that defeats the purpose of the service.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the keypad, Qiara offers a mobile app that lets you trigger the alarm and look at the live video feed from the security cameras. You can configure your system so that it is automatically turned off when your phone is around thanks to Bluetooth. You can also enable a privacy shutter when you\u2019re at home so that the security camera isn\u2019t filming your family.<\/p>\n<p>All modules work with batteries except the security camera. If there is a power or network failure, Qiara can still protect your home thanks to Sigfox network support.  Founded by Alexis Bidinot, a former executive at Iliad, the company has decided to design its connected devices in house.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, Qiara looks a bit like <a href=\"https:\/\/simplisafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimpliSafe<\/a> in the U.S. By default, you set up the security modules yourself and then you\u2019re good to go \u2014&nbsp;it\u2019s a DIY home security system. So let\u2019s see if Qiara can start from scratch and capture some market share in the home security market in France.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you live in France and you want to add a security system to your home, you don\u2019t have a ton of options.

He just really (really) enjoyed angel investing. In fact, by late 2013, when he was on the verge of selling the global classifieds marketplace <a href=\"https:\/\/www.olx.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OLX<\/a> &#8212; his third business &#8212; he says he had already written checks to more than 150 startups with his longtime friend and OLX cofounder Alec Oxenford. \u201cWe\u2019d been working together forever. It was really a family office that was angel investing at a massive scale,&#8221; Grinda recalls.<\/p>\n<p>Given that flurry of checks, potential LPs, including strategic investors, family offices, and founders began to express an interest in investing with them.\u00a0 Oxenford ultimately decided instead to cofound another marketplace, launching Letgo in 2015. (It was later acquired by rival OfferUp.) But Grinda leaned further into investing with another friend and serial entrepreneur, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jose-marin-093121\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jose Marin<\/a>, and by 2016, a Norwegian telecom company Telenor offered to provide exclusive funding to the duo, giving them $50 million to invest toward that end.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward, and their outfit, FJ Labs, has evolved from a two-man outfit to a sprawling firm with 34 employees, including eight investors and four &#8220;full-blown partners.&#8221; It began to grow in earnest in 2018, when LPs committed to invest $175 million with the outfit. Now, Grinda is announcing that FJ Labs has garnered $260 million in capital commitments across a pre-seed fund and an opportunity-style \u201cSeries B and beyond\u201d fund, with backing from family offices, institutional investors, and a wide array of founders, including of LinkedIn, PayPal, Supercell, Transferwise, MongoDB and Wayfair.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, over time, FJ Labs has come to look less like a &#8220;lab&#8221; and more like a traditional venture firm, though Grinda rejects the comparison.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are a venture fund,&#8221; he says, but one that does &#8220;angel investing at venture scale,&#8221; he insists. &#8220;We don&#8217;t lead. We don&#8217;t price. We don&#8217;t take board seats. We decide after two one-hour meetings over the course of a week whether we&#8217;ll invest or not because we have extraordinary pattern recognition that allows us to decide extremely quickly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It sounds high risk, yet FJ Labs has results to show for its approach. Among its many investments, for example, it has bet early on outfits that have ballooned over time, including Alibaba, Coupang, Flexport, and Delivery Hero.<\/p>\n<p>Focusing on marketplaces and network effects businesses &#8212; which Grinda knows well &#8212; certainly helps. So does the portfolio that FJ Labs has built over time, which includes 900 active investments as part of what Grinda describes as the &#8220;world&#8217;s largest marketplace portfolio.&#8221; (Pitchbook data supports that FJ Labs was the <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/news\/articles\/global-league-tables-q3-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most active venture outfit<\/a> globally in the third quarter of last year.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It all builds on itself like its own kind of flywheel, Grinda suggests, pointing to the firm&#8217;s deal flow to underscore the point. Through FJ Labs&#8217;s 900 companies, it has connections to roughly 2,000 founders, and they &#8220;come back for their next companies, and send us their friends and employees,&#8221; says Grinda.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, because FJ Labs is a &#8220;source of differentiated deal flow for the VCs, they invite us to their deals,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>FJ Labs will get bigger still if everything goes as planned. Grinda says that the &#8220;idea is to create an institution that is going to be a legacy and &#8220;be around &#8220;for decades.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine that Grinda, who is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/06\/14\/fashion\/a-curious-midlife-crisis-for-a-tech-entrepreneur.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">famously itinerant<\/a>, could stick with venture capital so long. But he says to believe it. Right now there are three problems FJ Labs would like to help address, while also making money, and none of them are minor. The first is inequality of opportunity, the second is climate change, and the third is the &#8220;mental and physical well-being crisis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One related bet is on User Interviews, a seven-year-old Brooklyn startup that helps user experience researchers source study participants across different demographics and behavioral criteria. (TechCrunch covered its newest funding <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/20\/user-interviews-which-helps-companies-recruit-survey-participants-raises-27-5m\/\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Other startups don&#8217;t easily fit into one of those three buckets, including Gravitics, a one-year-old Seattle startup that is developing living and work modules for space travel and that announced a $20 million round last year. (We covered <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/17\/gravitics-space-stations\/\">that round<\/a>, too.)<\/p>\n<p>Apparently, if there is a web3 angle, that also works. Just yesterday, a year-old London-based blockchain infrastructure company said it has <a href=\"https:\/\/siliconangle.com\/2023\/01\/23\/private-blockchain-sharding-startup-calimero-raises-8-5m\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$8.5 million<\/a> in seed funding to build private sharding capabilities for blockchain networks, with participation from FJ Labs.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of the firm&#8217;s bets boil down to what FJ Labs&#8217;s perspective on what the future of humanity looks like, offers Grinda. &#8220;We have a perspective on the future of food, automobiles, real estate, work . . . we&#8217;re trying to solve the world&#8217;s problems; we&#8217;re also thesis driven.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>You can find out more about what FJ Labs is funding and why from a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/16\/the-most-active-global-vc-firm-on-deal-terms-fatality-rates-and-the-drawbacks-of-credit-lines\/\">story we published<\/a> last month about the outfit, before FJ Labs closed its newest funds.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fabrice Grinda says he never intended to run a venture firm.

rel=\"noopener\">Getsafe<\/a> is adding a fourth market with today\u2019s product launch. In addition to Germany, Austria and the U.K., Getsafe is now going to offer insurance products in France. The company will first offer a home insurance product.<\/p>\n<p>Getsafe is trying to disrupt the insurance market with a focus on digital-first insurance products. It sells its products directly to end customers through its website and app <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/11\/wefox-grabs-400m-at-4-5b-valuation-to-buck-the-insurtech-downturn-trend\/\">unlike its German rival Wefox<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In its home market, Getsafe originally started with a home contents insurance product. But it has greatly diversified its lineup of products with the addition of private health insurance, drone liability insurance, pet health insurance and even some financial products like private pension plans.<\/p>\n<p>In October 2021, when the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/06\/german-insurtech-startup-getsafe-adds-63-million-to-its-series-b\/\">announced<\/a> a Series B extension of $63 million, Getsafe had 250,000 customers. It now has 400,000 clients as it is about to accept new customers in France. Getsafe has its own insurance license from Germany\u2019s financial regulator, BaFin.<\/p>\n<p>On the French market, the company is going to offer an all-in-one home insurance product. This kind of insurance products is particularly popular in France as home insurance is a legal requirement whether you own or you\u2019re renting your home. It usually protects the house or apartment against fires or water damages as well as the contents of your home. It also includes home liability insurance.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to be interesting to see if Getsafe manages to capture some market share as this is a crowded market. All legacy insurance companies offer home insurance products and still represent the majority of contracts. When it comes to newcomers, French startup <a href=\"https:\/\/fr.luko.eu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luko<\/a> also started with home insurance and now has 400,000 customers. Last year, Luko <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/19\/insurtech-startup-luko-acquires-coya-and-gains-insurance-license\/\">acquired Coya<\/a>, a German competitor. In other words, Getsafe and Luko now both operate in Germany and France.<\/p>\n<p>Lemonade, the publicly traded American insurtech, also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/07\/lemonade-launches-its-renters-insurance-in-france\/\">launched<\/a> its renters insurance in France. While Lemonade performed quite well on the stock market after its initial public offering, its shares <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/LMND\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropped<\/a> quite dramatically in late 2021 and 2022. The company\u2019s market capitalization is now just above the $1 billion mark.<\/p>\n<p>Lemonade\u2019s performance could have a chilling effect on the insurtech startup market. But that doesn\u2019t seem to stop Getsafe as the company already plans to launch more products on the French market thanks to its digital-first approach and direct-to-consumer distribution strategy. You can expect a private health insurance product, some travel insurance offerings or pet health insurance plans by the end of 2023.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2475015\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2475015\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"572\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2475015\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png 1196w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png?resize=300,168 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png?resize=768,429 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png?resize=680,380 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/image003-2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2475015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Getsafe<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>German insurtech startup Getsafe is adding a fourth market with today\u2019s product launch.

It&#8217;s no wonder &#8212; the VC firm Sequoia not long ago <a href=\"https:\/\/the-decoder.com\/sequoia-capital-bets-on-generative-ai-market-map-apps-horizons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicted<\/a> that generative AI, which comprises AI that can generate text, art and more from prompts, could yield trillions of dollars in economic value over the long run. Is that simply the optimistic musing of a firm heavily invested in the space? Perhaps. On the other hand, generative AI has proven to be a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/15\/despite-the-market-slowdown-companies-and-vcs-continue-to-invest-in-ai\/\">labor savor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/supernormal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supernormal<\/a> hopes to demonstrate the value of generative AI with its tech, which creates meeting notes by integrating with Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and other conferencing platforms. There&#8217;s lots of vendors in the meeting notes transcription space, which exploded during the pandemic as work-from-home setups became the norm. But Supernormal differentiates itself by extracting key details from meetings such as actions and decisions, relying on OpenAI&#8217;s text-processing AI to do the summarization work.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a strong sales pitch. Supernormal today announced that it raised $10 million in a funding round led by Balderton with participation from Acequia Capital and byFounders VC. The new cash brings the company&#8217;s total raised to around $12.9 million, which co-founder and CEO Colin Treseler says is being put toward product R&amp;D and hiring.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently, Supernormal has a small team of 5, which it expects to grow to 25 by the end of 2023 &#8212; mostly across engineering, marketing and [customer] success,&#8221; Treseler told TechCrunch in an email interview. &#8220;The new funding will be used to further the mission of delivering end-to-end workflow solutions based on foundational meeting data and develop next-generation tools that deliver actions and insights from conversations across the organization.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2472695\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2472695\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2472695\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627feb2e5f1eeeb8a98f22d7_Desktop-B-04-e1674157577927.png\" alt=\"Supernormal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2472695\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supernormal automatically transcribes and summarizes meetings.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Treseler co-founded Supernormal with Fabian Perez, who he met while working at a Balderton-funded company 13 years ago. (Treseler&#8217;s also held product manager roles at Meta and was the chief of staff in Klarna&#8217;s risk management department, while Perez was the director of design at GitHub.) In 2020, the two spent two weeks brainstorming what to build next. After long sessions, they realized that they didn\u2019t have any notes from the conversations, and that well-documented discussions were going to be critical to their success.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At an organization level, our meetings are a significant part of our work product that, until now, were ephemeral or too unwieldy to consume &#8212; who rewatches an hour-long meeting when the key notes are what are important?,&#8221; Treseler said. &#8220;We\u2019ve heard in particular that for product managers, team leads and client-facing teams that this product is particularly transformative as it helps them keep track of key updates and milestones with ease.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To that end, Supernormal&#8217;s platform, powered by OpenAI&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/gpt-3\/\">GPT-3<\/a> model, writes meeting and call notes across templated categories like &#8220;presentation,&#8221; &#8220;customer discovery call&#8221; and &#8220;interview.&#8221; Supernormal extracts details like customer objectives and goals, Treseler explains, and after a meeting attempts to automate action items like follow-up emails, scheduling and making introductions.<\/p>\n<p>Supernormal is self-learning &#8212; as users edit their notes, they&#8217;re improving the quality of notes that they get in their next call. But they can also delete any stored data if they choose for privacy reasons.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2472696\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2472696\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2472696\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png\" alt=\"Supernormal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png 2402w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=150,73 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=300,146 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=768,375 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=680,332 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=1536,749 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=2048,999 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=1200,586 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/627b41f823a3b71f3d7a01d5_Meet.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2472696\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Supernormal<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As companies contract, team members are going to be under pressure to continually hit deadlines and showcase value. A tool like Supernormal supports them at every stage of their job and takes that administrative pressure off them,&#8221; Treseler said. &#8220;It also takes the pressure off employees to be overly communicative and transparent, with Supernormal easily enabling this &#8212; helping to boost productivity and keep everyone connected regardless of location and time zones.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s here I should note that Supernormal&#8217;s capabilities aren&#8217;t\u00a0<em>super\u00a0<\/em>novel, no pun intended. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/otter-ai-meeting-summary-feature\/\">Otter<\/a>, a competitor, recently rolled out AI-generated meeting summaries.

The most comprehensive GPT-3 plan <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/sopmac-labs\/openai-api-pricing-in-words-per-dollar-9eeac857aee7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costs<\/a> around $0.02 per ~750 words, which sounds like a lot &#8212; until you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.free-power-point-templates.com\/articles\/how-many-slides-for-a-30-minute-presentation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consider<\/a> a 30-minute meeting transcript ranges between 3,000 and 6,000 words.<\/p>\n<p>Another, more existential business challenge is the desire among remote workers to move away from frequent meetings. In a July 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2022\/07\/stats-on-virtual-meetings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a> from RedRex, workers said they spent an average of 31 hours per month in unproductive meetings; 71% believed their work time was often wasted due to unnecessary or canceled meetings. Moreover, over half of the respondents said that they actively wanted to reduce how much time they spent in virtual meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Treseler admitted as much &#8212; and was loathe to share Supernormal&#8217;s revenue numbers. But he believes the growth is sustainable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As more companies have gone hybrid or fully remote, Supernormal is becoming an essential tool for distributed teams,&#8221; Treseler continued. &#8220;We\u2019ve seen explosive growth as teams try to figure out the hybrid or distributed model.

Essentially, a profile on the platform should look like a feature article in a fancy magazine.<\/p>\n<p>Clients also add job openings and more information about benefits, corporate culture and the existing team. Job seekers can then browse job offers and learn more about companies on Welcome to the Jungle\u2019s job board.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has also developed its own applicant tracking system and some companies use the platform directly for their hiring processes.

A cursory look at the bar graph might suggest that 2021 is an anomaly. Yes and no. Yes, as far as acceleration. No, as far as the long view.

Even as things reopened, jobs were increasingly difficult to fill and companies across the board were in a desperate push to automate. As nice as it might be, we\u2019re not ready to classify automation and robotics as \u201crecession-proof\u201d just yet. I do, however, suspect that those who control the purse strings fundamentally understand that these downward trends are more a product of the macroenvironment than anything specific to robotics.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>For some early-stage startups, however, that\u2019s cold comfort. A lot of runways shortened dramatically this year. Consolation could come somewhere down the road, but in a lot of cases decisive action needs to be taken for those who suddenly find themselves unable to close a round that might have felt like a foregone conclusion 12 months ago.<\/p>\n<p>Given the choice between getting acquired and shutting down that some will inevitably face, it seems likely that M&amp;A activity will spike. Sure there\u2019s less money floating around, but few can turn down a good fire sale. In some cases, that will go a ways toward strengthening products and portfolios.<\/p>\n<p>Anecdotally, I\u2019m seeing investments ramp up for the year, but that appears part of the natural cycle of companies waiting until after the holidays to announce. A proper bounce back, on the other hand, seems inevitable, but only those with high-powered crystal balls can say precisely when.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There was a brief, beautiful moment for a few months in 2021 when it felt like robotic investments might be immune from broader market forces.

As a result of previous restructurings, Tier is laying off around 80 workers, some of whom are under the Nextbike umbrella, to make up for redundancies. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/15\/e-scooter-startup-tier-buys-nextbike-to-double-down-on-commitment-to-e-bikes\/\">Tier had purchased the German bike-share startup<\/a>\u00a0in November 2021 to expand its vehicle offerings beyond e-scooters.<\/p>\n<p>Tier said the layoffs announced Wednesday will affect 7% of its overall staff headcount. While some teams will be more affected than others, the restructuring affects employees across the organization.<\/p>\n<p>The most recent staff cuts follow Tier&#8217;s decision to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/23\/tier-mobility-lays-off-180-people-amid-poor-funding-climate\/\">let 180 employees go<\/a> back in August, blaming a poor funding environment and uncertain economic conditions.<\/p>\n<p>The micromobility operator is also reducing the size of its Spin workforce by about 20 employees. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/tier-mobility-acquires-spin-from-ford-marking-entry-into-north-america\/\">Tier originally bought Spin from Ford<\/a> in March 2022, a move that gave the company widespread access to the U.S. Seven months later, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/03\/tier-mobility-owned-spin-lays-off-about-10-of-workforce-exits-two-markets\/\">Tier then laid off almost 80 Spin workers<\/a> and exited Seattle and Canada. The company went on to let go of an additional 30 Spin employees in December when it decided to<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/05\/tier-owned-spin-exits-10-us-markets-amid-low-demand-unfavorable-city-regulations\/\"> leave another 10 U.S. cities<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A Tier spokesperson told TechCrunch the company tried to rematch workers from redundant roles with any open roles at Tier and Nextbike to retain as many people as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8216;All-out growth mode&#8217; to &#8216;profitability first&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>How did Tier go from being the largest micromobility player in the world to now announcing layoffs every few months? Sure, the macroeconomic climate has affected most tech companies, and Tier is hardly the only micromobility operator to announce staff cuts (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/07\/bird-plans-to-layoff-23-of-staff\/\">lookin&#8217; at you, Bird<\/a>.) It seems that Tier, like most other tech companies facing hard decisions, was expanding for a pace of economic growth that&#8217;s simply not being realized in pre-recession 2023.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tier CEO and co-founder Lawrence Leuschner said today&#8217;s round of layoffs is part of a pivot in the company&#8217;s overall strategy, &#8220;from all-out growth mode to a &#8216;profitability first&#8217; mindset.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The restructuring will include the closure of &#8220;a small number of cities where we do not see a path to profitability&#8221; due to factors like unfavorable regulatory approaches, said the company. Tier did not say which cities it would exit, but the operator&#8217;s future in Paris currently hangs in the balance as <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/13\/scooters-in-paris-are-at-a-crossroad-and-it-could-shape-the-future-of-micromobility\/\">the city votes whether or not to renew the permits<\/a> of Tier, Lime and Dott. However, the city&#8217;s strict regulations might just make it unprofitable for Tier to be in Paris at this point.<\/p>\n<p>Tier is also shutting down a number of side projects, like its own vehicle design program and the Tier Energy Network, the company&#8217;s plan to place charging stations in retail stores to incentivize riders to swap scooter batteries for rewards. On the other hand, the company will be winding up its monthly scooter subscription service, MyTier.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Downsizing is challenging for any business and particularly difficult for a company like Spin, which has already made fundamental changes to the business to ensure its long-term future,&#8221; said Philip Reinckens, CEO at Spin. &#8220;We are confident that the measures to increase revenue while reducing costs via further integration with our parent company will accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"V8cCBpcIb9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/31\/micromobility-takeaways-paris-los-angeles-2022\/\">Micromobility in limbo: Takeaways from Paris and LA<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Micromobility in limbo: Takeaways from Paris and LA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/31\/micromobility-takeaways-paris-los-angeles-2022\/embed\/#?secret=VMaaFnDJNw#?secret=V8cCBpcIb9\" data-secret=\"V8cCBpcIb9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Around a year ago, Tier Mobility was winning the shared micromobility game.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell<\/a> is making an acquisition to beef up its cloud services business, specifically its offerings in DevOps: The company is buying <a href=\"https:\/\/cloudify.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cloudify<\/a>, an Israeli startup that has built a platform for cloud orchestration and infrastructure automation. Cloudify&#8217;s tools are used by cloud architects and DevOps engineers to manage containers, workloads, and more across hybrid environments.<\/p>\n<p>Dell did not officially announce the acquisition, but after sources contacted us, we noticed that Dell had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1571996\/000119312523014299\/d437187ds8.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actually published documents with the SEC<\/a> pertaining to some of the share awards for Cloudify employees. A spokesperson has now also confirmed the purchase to TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Dell Technologies announced that it has completed the acquisition of\u00a0Cloudify,&#8221; the spokesperson said. &#8220;This transaction allows Dell to continue to innovate our edge offerings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dell is not disclosing the value, or any other details, of the acquisition. Our sources tell us that the deal is valued at around $100 million.<\/p>\n<p>That would make it a solid exit for Cloudify. Originally the startup was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enterpriseai.news\/2017\/07\/27\/gigaspaces-orchestrates-cloud-spin-off\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spun out<\/a> from GigaSpaces in 2017 &#8212; Nati Shalom, the founder and CTO of Cloudify, was also a co-founder of GigaSpaces. Since then, the startup has <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/profile\/229561-84\/company\/profile#contact-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised less than $8 million<\/a>, according to PitchBook data. It has several strategic backers on its cap table: VMware, KPN, and Intel were all investors in Cloudify.<\/p>\n<p>Dell has been active in Israel since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkworld.com\/article\/2244658\/dell-snaps-up-bankrupt-exanet.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquiring Exanet in 2010<\/a>, which formed the basis of an R&amp;D operation in the country. That acquisition was for a song, relatively speaking: Exanet was bankrupt at the time and the deal was done for $12 million.<\/p>\n<p>From what we understand, Dell had been looking for acquisitions in this space for a while.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Cloudify&#8217;s pitch is at engineers who are grappling with managing network and data infrastructure at scaling organizations: It provides a platform that lets those DevOps engineers integrate and manage different products they may already be using &#8212; Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, ServiceNow, Jenkins, Azure, ARM and TOSCA among them &#8212; and automating the work of them working together.<\/p>\n<p>Avihai Michaeli, a startup advisor in the country, tells me that Dell long had its eye on Cloudify &#8212; which counts (in addition to its strategic backers) big names like AT&amp;T, Cox, Accenture, and many more as customers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cloudify was challenging Dell in more ways than one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For example it competed with Dell&#8217;s Enstratius.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dell is reporting results for Q4 at the beginning of March. Its market cap is currently at $29 billion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dell is making an acquisition to beef up its cloud services business, specifically its offerings in DevOps: The company is buying Cloudify, an Israeli startup that has built a platform for cloud orchestration and infrastructure automation.

Twitter was less equivocal at the time, issuing Trump a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/trump-banned-from-twitter\/\">lifetime ban from its services<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s own decision seemed permanent, but two years later SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk purchased the social company, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/19\/donald-trump-unbanned-twitter-elon-musk\/\">reversing that decision<\/a> and many other suspensions that the company made in the course of enforcing its guidelines against hate and harassment.<\/p>\n<p>While Trump&#8217;s path to a mainstream social media return is now cleared, the former president <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/16\/trump-twitter-return-truth-social\/#!\">might be in his own way<\/a>. According to SEC filings, Trump remains under an exclusivity agreement with his own social media company Truth Social that requires he post content there six hours before sharing it to other platforms. Beyond that, Trump is &#8220;generally obligated&#8221; to stick with Truth Social rather than mainstream social networks like Twitter and Facebook, though the contract expires in June and he&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/politics\/politics-features\/donald-trump-ditch-truth-social-for-twitter-facebook-1234665307\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apparently eager to be done with it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meta&#8217;s Oversight Board noted that it was made aware of the company&#8217;s decision yesterday and while it had no role in dictating the outcome, it approved of the company&#8217;s process.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today\u2019s decision by Meta is a pivotal moment in the debate over the best way to handle harmful content posted by politicians on social media,&#8221; the Oversight Board <a href=\"https:\/\/oversightboard.com\/news\/6274494105946760-oversight-board-response-to-meta-s-announcement-on-former-president-trump\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote in a blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As Meta wrote, there are arguments on both sides of the debate over where to draw the line on what content should be allowed online. Independent oversight of decisions related to speech on social media platforms is why the Board was set up \u2014 to ensure that companies act in a transparent and accountable manner.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>This story is developing&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two years after the company formerly known as Facebook suspended then-president Donald Trump&#8217;s account, it&#8217;s bringing him back.

edtech is showing its resilience<\/a><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">During the darkest<\/span> days of the pandemic, money was no object in many developed markets.<\/p>\n<p>Governments, public sector organizations and many private companies moved heaven and earth to ensure public safety and adequate supply of core services. Quite clearly, spending reached unsustainable levels.<\/p>\n<p>But 2022 was the year when this &#8220;spending&#8221; slowed and was instead more widely rebranded and accepted as actually being &#8220;borrowing.&#8221; This realization justified the beginning of deep cuts in public spending compared to before and during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these cuts, which have been always slower to implement than communicate, inflation has been rampant across Europe and beyond, partially due to supply chain issues linked to the situation in Ukraine. Wages failing to rise in line with inflation as well as cuts to public services have led to a cost-of-living crisis in many markets.<\/p>\n<p>These conditions are not conducive to inducing confidence for investors or founders. Edtech, and education more broadly, usually one of the more resistant sectors during times of economic crisis, has not been immune to the downturn.<\/p>\n<p>Against this background, we formed our annual review of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighteyevc.com\/post\/the-european-edtech-funding-report-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European edtech activity for 2022<\/a>. For the first time since 2014, venture capital funding to European edtech startups saw a decline year-over-year, with startups raking in $1.8 billion in 2022 compared to $2.5 billion a year earlier.<\/p>\n<p>The global ecosystem has been on an upward trajectory, albeit less consistently, but the declines in new investment in 2022 were steep: globally funding declined to $9.1 billion last year from $20.1 billion in 2021. This is in line with macro trends in the public markets as well as other tech sectors (both trends were highlighted in our <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/04\/edtechs-honeymoon-might-be-over-but-expect-a-second-boom\/\">October report with Dealroom<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tItaly was the only European market to see a hike in both funding and the number of deals.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Perceived declines in funding are being felt more acutely, given that 2021 was a boom year. Optimism that the pandemic was coming to an end and that the world was reopening extended to ambitious founders and early teams. This momentum carried through to the first half of 2022 for European edtech. Indeed, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/15\/despite-creaky-markets-european-edtech-is-showing-its-resilience\/\">we reported in July<\/a>, European edtech funding was up 40% in the first six months of last year compared to a year earlier.<\/p>\n<p>But as we now know, that momentum faltered in the second half of 2022. Optimism ebbed away, and European edtech startups raised only about $400 million in the latter six months compared to $1.4 billion in the other half of the year.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the sector proved more resilient in Europe than in other major regions. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the region saw more edtech deals happening in the second half than in the first half of 2022, but they were simply smaller and more early-stage rounds at lower valuations.<\/p>\n<p>Europe fared well compared to the rest of the world, though: Edtech VC funding only declined 28% in Europe, compared to a 64% fall in the U.S., a 46% contraction in India, and a 32% decline in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<h2>Funding fell the least in Europe and RoW, with the steepest drop once again in China<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2475353\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2475353\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2475353\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png\" alt=\"Funding declined across markets but Europe saw a modest decline.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png 2220w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=150,41 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=300,82 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=768,210 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=680,186 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=1536,421 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=2048,561 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=1200,329 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/IMAGE-1-regional.png?resize=50,14 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2475353\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Funding declined across markets but Europe saw a modest decline. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brighteye Ventures<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In Europe, we see the UK retaining the top spot in funding and deal activity.

Italy\u2019s tech ecosystem has been growing gradually as momentum has built relatively consistently since 2010.

Though edtech in Italy had a record year in 2019, largely driven by the large round raised by Talent Garden, it&#8217;s quite promising to see the upward trend in 2022 being driven by smaller,

spares three Area 120 R&#038;D projects, including team working on a &#8216;Gen Z consumer product&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Last week, we learned Google&#8217;s in-house R&amp;D group, Area 120, had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/20\/area-120-googles-in-house-incubator-severely-impacted-by-alphabet-mass-layoffs\/\">been severely impacted<\/a> by the broader <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/20\/google-parent-alphabet-cuts-6-of-its-workforce-impacting-12000-people\/\">Google workforce reduction<\/a>, impacting teams working on some of Google&#8217;s more experimental ideas. However, we understand now that at least three Area 120 projects have been spared from these latest cuts and will go on to &#8220;graduate&#8221; to other parts of Google later this year. These include <a href=\"https:\/\/aloud.area120.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aloud<\/a>, an automated and less costly <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/area-120\/aloud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video dubbing solution<\/a>; a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/22\/googles-area-120-debuts-checks-an-ai-powered-privacy-compliance-solution-for-mobile-apps\/\">privacy platform for app developers<\/a> called <a href=\"https:\/\/checks.area120.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checks<\/a>; and <a href=\"https:\/\/liist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Liist<\/a>, a consumer app quietly acquired by Google last year.<\/p>\n<p>Most Area 120 projects have been developed in-house, making Liist a rare exception. The startup, which had raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/liist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$1.1 million in seed funding<\/a>\u00a0according to Crunchbase, offered a <a href=\"https:\/\/appadvice.com\/app\/liist-make-maps-with-friends\/1488479790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social bookmarking tool for saving places<\/a> you find on the internet, including through apps like TikTok and Instagram. At Google&#8217;s Area 120, the team had been tasked with building a new consumer product.<\/p>\n<p>While Aloud and Checks have obvious utility, easily fitting into other parts of Google&#8217;s organization, Liist is perhaps the more intriguing of the three Area 120 survivors. Ahead of Liist&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cg-pLXTD1R5\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acquisition<\/a>, Google had spoken about the threat to its core search and advertising businesses posed by TikTok and Instagram. At an industry event, Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan, who runs Google\u2019s Knowledge &amp; Information organization, <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/12\/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps\/\">told an interviewer<\/a> that the search giant&#8217;s own research found that young people now often didn&#8217;t start their searches for places on Google.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they\u2019re looking for a place for lunch, they don\u2019t go to Google Maps or Search,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go to TikTok or Instagram.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When live, Liist&#8217;s bookmarking app had touted a variety of use cases that included things like saving places for travel inspiration, planning nights out with friends, creating lists of date night spots, and more. Users could vote on where they wanted to go or could plan trips together, too.

Last September, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/14\/google-cancels-half-the-projects-at-its-internal-rd-group-area-120\/\">company slashed Area 120&#8217;s 14 projects in development to just seven<\/a> and told impacted employees they&#8217;d need to find new roles within Google. At the time, a Google spokesperson explained the group would be shifting its focus to projects that &#8220;build on Google\u2019s deep investment in A.I.&#8221; and &#8221; have the potential to solve important user problems.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bavor&#8217;s new email to Area 120 employees similarly highlights how Google&#8217;s experimentation is now more intensely focused on the impacts of AI across Google products, not the other types of projects that Area 120 became known for in prior years. As Bavor writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s clear that, as a company, we continue to face macroeconomic uncertainties. At the same time, there are enormous opportunities ahead of us in applying AI to reimagining so many of Google\u2019s core products. With this as backdrop, I&#8217;ve made the difficult decision to wind down the majority of Area 120. For nearly seven years, Area 120 has been a source of bottom-up innovation across Google, and from it we\u2019ve learned many lessons on how best to pursue zero-to-one opportunities. But with the unprecedented opportunities ahead of us, we need to shift to a model of new product development that is opinionated and focused.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I know this change is significant and unsettling. What hasn\u2019t changed is the size of the opportunity ahead of us, especially in applied AI. Across our domains, I believe that Labs is doing some of the most important and potentially impactful work at Google. And now more than ever, the company is looking to us to execute well. I have full confidence that we will navigate this moment as a team and deliver in 2023.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The email comes in addition to Google and Alphabet&#8217;s CEO Sundar Pichai&#8217;s email about the layoffs, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/inside-google\/message-ceo\/january-update\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which was publicly shared<\/a> on Google&#8217;s &#8220;The Keyword&#8221; blog.<\/p>\n<p>Google declined to comment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YdhdHCmqL6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/20\/area-120-googles-in-house-incubator-severely-impacted-by-alphabet-mass-layoffs\/\">Area 120, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, severely impacted by Alphabet mass layoffs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Area 120, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, severely impacted by Alphabet mass layoffs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/20\/area-120-googles-in-house-incubator-severely-impacted-by-alphabet-mass-layoffs\/embed\/#?secret=yd8azi7BhA#?secret=YdhdHCmqL6\" data-secret=\"YdhdHCmqL6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, we learned Google&#8217;s in-house R&amp;D group, Area 120, had been severely impacted by the broader Google workforce reduction, impacting teams working on some of Google&#8217;s more experimental ideas.

The company closed out Q4 with $24.3 billion in revenue, a 37% increase from the same quarter last year and a 13% bump quarter-over-quarter. Analysts had expected the company to earn around $24.2 billion, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/TSLA\/analysis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yahoo Finance data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The electric vehicle maker had $1.4 billion in free cash flow at the end of Q4, which is down from the $3.3 billion the company had in the bank at the end of the third quarter.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s stock saw a 3.2% spike to $149 per share immediately after earnings dropped and continued to rise to $151.52 in after-hours trading.<\/p>\n<h2>The effect of price cuts on margins<\/h2>\n<p>Investors today were on the lookout for gross margins after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/13\/tesla-keeps-slashing-prices-this-time-by-as-much-as-20\/\">Tesla slashed prices<\/a> and offered <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/01\/tesla-offers-3750-discount-for-model-3-model-y-deliveries-in-december\/\">multiple discounts<\/a> on its vehicles. While Tesla as a whole closed the quarter with a 16% operating margin, automotive gross margins came in at 25.9%, which is the lowest figure in the last five quarters.<\/p>\n<p>Margins in the first quarter of 2023 might look worse, says Eric Schiffer, the CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;The outlook will still depend on the recent moves of Q1, which suggest some compression in demand,&#8221; Schiffer told TechCrunch, referring to January&#8217;s price cuts.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla acknowledged that short-term automotive margins will be impacted by the decrease in prices and the general inflationary environment, but the company&#8217;s management is more focused on its operating margin.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;As other areas of the business become more important, and particularly the energy business which is growing faster than the vehicle business, we&#8217;re heavily focused on operating leverage here and improving the efficiency of our overheads,&#8221; said Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla&#8217;s chief financial officer, during Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Elon Musk wanted to put concerns around demand to bed during the call, saying that after the company brought down prices, January saw the strongest demand ever in Tesla&#8217;s history. In fact, he said, demand exceeds production.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 405,278 in the fourth quarter. While those were record deliveries, the automaker still <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/02\/tesla-delivers-405278-vehicles-in-q4-missing-wall-street-expectations\/\">missed Wall Street estimates<\/a> for the third quarter in a row. Similarly, Tesla&#8217;s 1.3 million vehicle deliveries in 2022 was also a record for the automaker, but that number misses Tesla&#8217;s own guidance of achieving 50% growth YoY and getting to 1.4 million deliveries.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, Tesla still intends to grow production as quickly as possible &#8220;in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021,&#8221; and reach 1.8 million cars in 2023. During Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call, Musk said Tesla has the potential to reach 2 million cars this year but is being cautious given market uncertainty.<\/p>\n<h2>Prioritizing &#8220;affordability&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>The company acknowledged that average sales prices have &#8220;generally been on a downward trajectory for many years,&#8221; and that Tesla aims to prioritize &#8220;affordability&#8221; so that it can grow into a company that sells multiple millions of cars annually.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Price really matters,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;The vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car, can&#8217;t afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Musk went on to say that Tesla is working on cost control measures like factory efficiencies, which will manifest this year in the ramp of production at the new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin, better control of the supply chain and even design changes, specifically to the powertrain.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla also announced earlier this week <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/24\/tesla-invests-3-6b-in-two-new-nevada-factories-to-build-semis-and-cells\/\">plans to invest an additional $3.6 billion<\/a> into its Nevada gigafactory to build a battery cell facility and a Semi truck factory. In terms of battery cells, the company&#8217;s long-term goal is to get &#8220;well in excess of 1000 gigawatt hours of cells produced internally,&#8221; said Musk, noting that the company would also rely on third-party battery cell producers like Panasonic to keep costs down and efficiency up. Musk also nodded to Tesla&#8217;s plan to make a 4680 cell that will have low-cost and high-energy density.<\/p>\n<p>The EV tax incentives for vehicles produced in the U.S. and with battery components sourced from U.S. or free trade agreement countries might also help Tesla bring its prices down, said Kirkhorn.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are on our products going forward,&#8221; said Kirkhorn.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing costs of the vehicles down will also be a necessity for the automaker as it, along with everyone else, faces macroeconomic pressures, a looming recession and increasing competition from other automakers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Tesla is not immune [to] the recession, and I still expect to see more recession-driven market pain,&#8221; said Schiffer.<\/p>\n<h2>Autonomy, electrification and energy solutions<\/h2>\n<p>Tesla said it remains focused on &#8220;autonomy, electrification and energy solutions.&#8221; The company&#8217;s energy storage arm finished out 2022 with the &#8220;highest level&#8221; of deployments ever. Energy storage deployments increased 152% from Q4 in 2021 to 2.5 GWh, for a total 2022 deployment of 6.5 GWh. Tesla said demand for its storage products &#8220;remains in excess of [its] ability to supply.&#8221; The company said it is ramping up production at its 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California, to address demand.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s solar deployments also increased 18% YoY in Q4 to 100 MW, with a total 348 MW of solar deployed in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system, Tesla said it had sold its beta version of the software to roughly 400,000 customers, bringing in revenue recognition of $324 million as part of the company&#8217;s automotive sales.<\/p>\n<h2>On Elon tweeting<\/h2>\n<p>One investor asked Musk if his constant stream of consciousness on Twitter might cause the Tesla brand to lose popularity and cause division among customers, thus impacting demand. Musk brushed this concern aside, pulling up his Twitter account to demonstrate his 127 million followers, which &#8220;suggests that I&#8217;m, you know, reasonably popular.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;The net value of Twitter, apart from a few people complaining, is gigantic. Obviously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Cybertruck production to ramp in 2024<\/h2>\n<p>Musk also addressed the long-delayed Cybertruck, a vehicle he said he will definitely be driving once it comes off the assembly lines.<\/p>\n<p>The CEO confirmed that start of production for the truck will likely still happen this summer, but SOP is slow, he said. Volume production is when things really get going, and that is scheduled for next year.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla said it has begun installation on the production equipment for the Cybertruck in Texas and has built all of its beta vehicles, with more coming in the next month.<\/p>\n<p>The company will share more details about its upcoming plans across the board at its investor day on March 1.<\/p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Eric Schiffer was a Tesla investor, and he is not.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JTPsHgKoT7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/25\/tesla-energy-storage-q4-2022-earnings\/\">Tesla&#8217;s energy storage arm caps 2022 with &#8216;highest level&#8217; of deployments ever<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tesla&#8217;s energy storage arm caps 2022 with &#8216;highest level&#8217; of deployments ever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/25\/tesla-energy-storage-q4-2022-earnings\/embed\/#?secret=MGHlGmpeVQ#?secret=JTPsHgKoT7\" data-secret=\"JTPsHgKoT7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tesla just beat Wall Street revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of 2022.

The data contained all the information that a criminal would need to make fraudulent transactions and purchases using a cardholder&#8217;s information.<\/p>\n<p>The credit card numbers belong to customers who made purchases through a network of near-identical online stores claiming to sell designer goods and apparel. But the stores had the same security problem in common: Any time a customer made a purchase, their credit card data and billing information was saved in a database, which was left exposed to the internet without a password. Anyone who knew the IP address of the database could access reams of unencrypted financial data.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hak1mlukha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anurag Sen<\/a>, a good-faith security researcher, found the exposed credit card records and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting it to its owner. Sen has a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/19\/oracle-bluekai-web-tracking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">respectable<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/27\/amazon-prime-video-server-exposed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">track<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/justalk-spilled-millions-of-user-messages-and-locations-for-months\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record<\/a> of scanning the internet looking for exposed servers and inadvertently published data, and reporting it to companies to get their systems secured.<\/p>\n<p>But in this case, Sen wasn&#8217;t the first person to discover the spilling data. According to a ransom note left behind on the exposed database, someone else had found the spilling data and, instead of trying to identify the owner and responsibly reporting the spill, the unnamed person instead claimed to have taken a copy of the entire database&#8217;s contents of credit card data and would return it in exchange for a small sum of cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>A review of the data by TechCrunch shows most of the credit card numbers are owned by cardholders in the United States. Several people we contacted confirmed that their exposed credit card data was accurate.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has identified several online stores whose customers&#8217; information was exposed by the leaky database. Many of the stores claim to operate out of Hong Kong. Some of the stores are designed to sound similar to big-name brands, like Sprayground, but whose websites have no discernible contact information, typos and spelling mistakes, and a conspicuous lack of customer reviews. Internet records also show the websites were set up in the past few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these websites include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<pre>spraygroundusa.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>ihuahebuy.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>igoodlinks.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>ibuysbuy.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>lichengshop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>hzoushop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>goldlyshop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>haohangshop.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>twinklebubble.store<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<pre>spendidbuy.com<\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you bought something from one of those sites in the past few weeks, you might want to consider your banking card compromised and contact your bank or card provider.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear who is responsible for this network of knockoff stores. TechCrunch contacted a person via WhatsApp whose Singapore-registered phone number was listed as the point of contact on several of the online stores. It&#8217;s not clear if the contact number listed is even involved with the stores, given one of the websites listed its location as a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Houston, Texas.<\/p>\n<p>Internet records showed that the database was operated by a customer of Tencent, whose cloud services were used to host the database. TechCrunch contacted Tencent about its customer&#8217;s database leaking credit card information, and the company responded quickly. The customer&#8217;s database went offline a short time later.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we learned of the incident, we immediately contacted the customer who operates the database and it was shut down immediately. Data privacy and security are top priorities at Tencent.
