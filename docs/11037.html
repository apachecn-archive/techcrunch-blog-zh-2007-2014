<p class="translated">更有趣的是，在Interbrand的报告中排名较高的品牌实际上在各种应用程序商店中的应用程序数量更多。app越多，排名越高。需要说明的是，这并不是说应用程序<em>导致</em>品牌排名上升。这更有可能反映了世界上最大的品牌保持应用商店的存在越来越重要。</p>

<p class="translated">这些品牌中的许多也是大量应用发行商——每个品牌的平均应用数量是24个。应该注意的是，这个平均值是由于像迪士尼这样的异常值(636个应用！)和索尼(285个应用)，都是非常大的发行商。然而，即使你将这两项从平均值中剔除，每个品牌仍有15份申请。</p>
