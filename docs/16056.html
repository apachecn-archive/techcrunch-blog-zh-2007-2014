<p class="translated">这一消息是在Android应用下载量已经超过iOS应用下载量10%的时候发布的。按市场份额计算，Android现在是全球领先的智能手机平台，有趣的是，看看它还需要走多远才能在收入方面领先。</p>
<p class="translated">今天的报告还指出，过去一个季度，几个新兴市场表现突出——巴西、俄罗斯和印度。在2013年Q2 Google Play排名中，巴西上升了两位，与俄国和印度并列前五。</p>
<p class="translated">与此同时，2013年俄罗斯在Q2的iOS应用商店上升了三个名次(比去年Q2上升了6个名次),成为除美国之外唯一一个在iOS应用商店(排名第五)和Google Play(排名第四)下载量排名前五的国家。</p>
<p class="translated">美国和中国仍然是下载量最高的两个市场，占2013年Q2下载量的40%左右。</p>

<p class="translated">视频应用在6月份也变得越来越受欢迎，Vine上升了三个位置，在iOS应用商店的下载量中排名第一。YouTube当时排名第二，Snapchat排名第三，Instagram最近增加了视频支持，排名第五。今年6月，Vine在英国的表现尤其出色(见下文)。</p>
