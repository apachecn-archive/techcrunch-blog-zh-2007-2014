<p class="translated">除了那个极其详尽的名字，这件事让我头晕。我仍然有点纠结于这款手机和美国电话电报公司的GSII，但就设计而言，GSII Epic 4G Touch相当好看。直边和圆角(与完全圆形的T-Mo迭代相反)看起来和感觉起来都很锐利。这也让我想起了另一款你可能听说过的流行手机，iPhone 4。</p>
<p class="translated">问题是:Sprint的迭代和T-Mo的一样，都有4.52英寸的Super AMOLED Plus显示屏。这听起来非常笨重，但实际上它真的很棒。问题是，Sprint的4.52英寸显示屏和美国电话电报公司的4.3英寸显示屏都号称分辨率为800 x 480像素，这意味着美国电话电报公司的显示屏看起来超级丰富和流畅，而Sprint的相比之下有点像素化。</p>
<p class="translated">拿在手里，史诗般的4G Touch并没有看上去那么有吸引力。感觉有点……便宜——几乎就像它这么大而言太轻了。我知道光应该是一个好东西，但这里的重量感觉不好。</p>
<p class="translated">我想这是你的电话，但对我来说，它缺乏良好的，坚实的感觉。</p>

<p class="translated">我不喜欢厚此薄彼，但美国电话电报公司的版本最受欢迎。为什么？因为更大的屏幕并不总是意味着更好的屏幕。正如我之前所说，由于美国电话电报公司一直忠于Galaxy S II的4.3英寸屏幕，这款设备的800 x 480分辨率绝对是华丽的。</p>
<p class="translated">你可能会认为不同型号之间的差异很小，但在拍摄图片和视频时，这种差异就变得非常明显。增加的像素密度有所不同，尤其是当手机并排放置时。</p>
<p class="translated">我们通常不太喜欢制造商喜欢在他们的Android设备上安装的这些自定义用户界面，但新的和改进的TouchWiz并不那么糟糕。它明显比我们之前看到的版本更快，更简洁。这当然不是我们喜欢的手机功能，但至少三星在UI方面有所改进。</p>
<p class="translated">虽然它比T-Mobile小了一根头发，但美国电话电报公司的变体设计比T-Mobile更棱角分明。事实上，它与国际版Galaxy S II几乎完全相同——这对我们来说完全没问题。我的意思是，那款车在上市的头55天里卖出了300万辆。如果没坏的话，对吧？</p>

<p class="translated">曾经被称为大力神的T-Mo的GSII仍然有些神秘。他们把这个藏在玻璃后面，所以我们实际上并没有和它亲密接触。然而，我可以诚实地说，这不是我最喜欢的S II外形；这些曲线和4.5英寸的屏幕尺寸使它有点像Infuse和Nexus S的混合体，只是看起来不如其他两个版本时尚。</p>
<p class="translated">屏幕很漂亮，但同样，像素分辨率与Sprint Epic 4G Touch相同。由于三星不会让pink的版本开箱，所以很难说它是否会像Sprint的那样“太轻”。不管怎样，这肯定会是T-Mo最畅销的书之一。</p>
