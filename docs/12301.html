				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated"><strong>更新:</strong>门票现已售完。请务必留意门票赠品以及我们何时发布下一批门票。</p>
<p class="translated">提名已经列成表格，投票结果也出来了。超过300，000个提名涵盖了20个类别。与我们的合作伙伴<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://gigaom.com/" target="_blank"> GigaOm </a>和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://venturebeat.com/" target="_blank"> VentureBeat </a>一起，我们非常自豪地宣布2011年最佳技术的决赛入围者。<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://crunchies2011.beta.techcrunch.com/vote/">投票现在开始</a>。</p>
<p class="translated">2011年，我们增加了一些新的类别。今年，最佳定位应用、最佳云服务和最大社交影响力加入了Crunchies的行列。你还会发现最佳社交应用，纽约市主导的最佳购物应用类别，最佳新创企业和年度最佳风投和天使投资人。像TaskRabbit的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://www.crunchbase.com/person/leah-busque"> Leah Busque </a>和<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://www.crunchbase.com/person/keith-rabois"> Keith Rabois </a>因其天使投资(Airbnb、LinkedIn、Yammer、Path、YouTube)而进入决赛的新人，以及马克·安德森、杰克·多西、马克·平卡斯和罗恩·康韦等行业热门人物也榜上有名。</p>
<p class="translated">今年有一些相当不错的比赛。Google+与《脸书时间线》争夺最佳社交应用，还有新的Twitter、Instagram和Path 2.0。Kindle Fire正在与iPad 2竞争最佳新设备。Pinterest、Turntable.fm、Nest、Fab和Codecademy都在竞争最佳新创公司(尽管其中两个是完全的支点)。LinkedIn创始人雷德·霍夫曼被提名年度天使。他在Zynga的种子投资价值是他买价的160倍。但AngelList的创始人纳瓦·拉维坎特和巴巴克·尼维也因帮助天使投资民主化而入围该类别，其他入围者还有康威、拉博伊斯、Y Combinator的保罗·格拉厄姆和凯文·罗斯(他拥有包括Twitter、Foursquare、Zynga和square在内的杀手级投资组合)。谁会赢？</p>
<p class="translated">每个人都有资格并被鼓励投票给。<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://crunchies2011.beta.techcrunch.com/rules/">规则</a>规定，在太平洋标准时间2012年1月29日周日晚上11:59投票结束之前，您每天可以针对每个奖项类别投票一次。有20个奖项类别开放投票，表彰各种领域和角色的最高成就。如果你是决赛选手之一，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://crunchies2011.beta.techcrunch.com/embed">制作一枚徽章</a>，让你的社区为这一荣誉而兴奋，并让他们为你投票。获胜者将于1月31日在Crunchies现场揭晓。</p>
<p class="translated">除了今天宣布的决赛选手，我们很高兴通过<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://crunchies2011.eventbrite.com/"> Eventbrite </a>发布我们的下一批门票。现在发布开始了，所以行动要快，在你能得到的时候<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230302192330/http://crunchies2011.eventbrite.com/">得到它们</a>。</p>
