<p class="translated">更新一下，三星Captivate Glide将在美国电话电报公司的4G HSPA+网络上运行，并运行Android 2.3姜饼。它配备了4英寸的Super AMOLED触摸屏，引擎盖下有一个双核1GHz处理器。你会发现背面有一个800万像素的闪光灯，能够以1080p拍摄视频，还有一个130万像素的前置摄像头，用于视频聊天。它有1GB的内存，8GB的内部内存，支持高达32GB的microSD卡。当然，Captivate Glide支持HDMI out，当然还配备了滑动式四排QWERTY键盘。</p>
<p class="translated">乍一看，Captivate Glide并不一定出众。它很像你以前见过的任何其他Android滑盖手机，但在性能方面可以与Droid RAZR和HTC Rezound竞争。事实上，如果你正面看它，Captivate Glide让我想起了许多<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230210005053/https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/30/hands-on-samsungs-galaxy-s-ii-for-att-t-mobile-and-sprint/">三星Galaxy S II </a>，有圆角和非常(抱歉这么说，三星)类似iPhone的形状。</p>

<p class="translated">然后你拿起手机，发现它厚了很多(当然，是为了给QWERTY键盘腾出空间)，背面有一层漂亮的纹理。它可能会比你的标准塑料背板拾取更多的碎屑，但它也更舒适，握感更好，感觉有点贵。键盘摸起来很结实，来回滑动很顺畅。480×800的显示屏还好，但没有像SGS II上的Super AMOLED Plus显示屏那样让我刮目相看。</p>
<p class="translated">Captivate Glide实际上比它看起来更轻，但我仍然不一定称它为轻。虽然它与外面的一些大家伙有一些共同的规格，但你肯定是在为QWERTY滑动键盘放弃一个薄的小腰线。大多数滑块都是这种情况，喜欢物理键盘的文字爱好者往往已经知道这是等式的一部分，但它仍然值得注意。</p>
<p class="translated">总而言之，三星Captivate Glide是一个智能的小滑块，应该可以为目前主导市场的无键盘糖果提供一个可靠的、强规格的替代品。价格和可用性尚未公布。</p>
