<p class="translated">《迫不及待》是一款基于YouTube API构建的流畅的移动电影预告片播放器。这并不是第一个包含电影预告片的应用程序(例如，参见Flixster和Fandango等电影应用程序)，但该应用程序非常注重与其他用户互动，并在你感兴趣的电影上映时提醒你。</p>
<p class="translated">电影爱好者可以下载该应用程序来观看最近的电影预告片，其中包括按照刚刚添加的，流行的和上映日期进行排序的选项。在观看预告片后，用户可以选择与内部和外部的特定朋友分享，或者通过点击Gonna Pass或不能等待与应用程序的所有用户分享。</p>
<p class="translated">按下“迫不及待”按钮还会让你收到电影何时上映、其他类似预告片何时发布、或者朋友何时推荐的通知。联合创始人计划在以后的版本中加入更多的社交功能，比如评论朋友关于预告片的帖子。</p>
<p class="translated">当然，因为电影预告片基本上是转化为剧院门票销售的第一点，你可以从应用程序内购买电影票——不能等待通过从Fandango收取会员费来赚钱。此外，点击迫不及待与好友分享一部预告片(本质上是带入新用户)的人有机会赢得一张免费电影票。两位联合创始人正在考虑将其扩展成某种受电影Groupon启发的功能。</p>
<p class="translated">Florenzano说，最终他希望《不能等待》将帮助人们组织与朋友外出的夜晚，他们计划建立算法技术，帮助人们展示他们最想看的预告片。他希望看到消费内容的迫不及待模式扩展到视频游戏、音乐和消费电子产品。一款Android应用也正在开发中。</p>
<p class="translated">“人们很无聊，他们坐在火车站、公共汽车站，他们拿着手机，有时间打发时间，”弗洛伦萨诺说。“他们没有时间看完整部电影或做一些重要的事情，但他们有1到2分钟的时间看预告片。我们不是在治愈癌症，但我们在帮助人们获得乐趣。”</p>
