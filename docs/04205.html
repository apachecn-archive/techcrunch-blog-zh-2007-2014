<p class="translated">当SXSW设立它的节日时，你必须假设他们想要最好的和最吸引人的主题演讲。如果公众对Umair Haque对Twitter联合创始人Ev Williams的<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230213025734/https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/15/ev-williams-sxsw/">采访</a>的反应有任何暗示的话，他们失败了。很糟糕。</p>
<p class="translated">我希望我能在这里获得标题的荣誉，但这一切都是<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230213025734/http://twitter.com/Mike_FTW/status/10532266282">迈克·蒙泰罗</a>，通过Twitter的方式。下面，找到一些关于主题演讲的其他最佳推文的样本。作为观众中的一员，这些似乎都很准确。</p>
<p class="translated">威廉姆斯在会谈中也有一些消息要宣布。可悲的是，他在头两分钟就把这一点说了出来，然后随着采访的进行，人群的大批离去和幽默的推文完全掩盖了这一点。</p>
<p class="translated"><strong>更新</strong> : Ev Williams刚刚<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230213025734/http://twitter.com/ev/status/10535743657">发推特</a>说他听到了关于面试的谈话，并愿意通过推特回答10个问题。送走。</p>
