<p class="translated">该相机具有4K视频录制功能，带有新的CRI LED闪光灯，应该可以改善弱光摄影。三星声称，在播放视频时，电池寿命延长了近四个小时，正常使用时的总体性能也应该比上一代产品延长了40%。</p>
<p class="translated">三星强调Galaxy Note的工艺，它采用了缝合的皮革后盖(有黑色、白色和粉色可供选择)。它还有一个金属边缘，还有一个翻盖钱包配件，有10种不同的颜色，还具有一个更大的S View窗口盖，用于查看信息，拨打电话和访问更多信息，而不必激活整个显示屏。</p>

<p class="translated">新的S Pen设计用于更大的屏幕。三星称之为开启Note功能和力量的“钥匙”。这通过许多新的界面控件来实现。当你可以激活“Air Command”时，屏幕上会出现一个点，这是一个工具轮，可以快速访问备忘录、剪贴簿、编剧和finder搜索功能。还有一种三星称为“circle”的东西，它使用圆圈绘制手势来捕捉你想保存到剪贴簿的内容，通过Air Command调用。Box是一种多任务处理方式，让你通过一个画中画的界面同时做两件事。</p>
