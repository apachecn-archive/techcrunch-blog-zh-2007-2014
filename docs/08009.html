				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">也许你还记得，早在6月份，对于苹果即将推出的iCloud产品套件是否会有网络应用，人们有些困惑。虽然我们从一开始就坚持说<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230215134419/https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/apple-icloud-google-cloud/">我们听说会有</a>，但有些人确信<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230215134419/http://thisismynext.com/2011/06/13/icloud-apple-strategy-flaw/">不会有</a>—<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230215134419/https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/apple-hates-the-internet-except-not/">再次反驳了</a>。无论如何，这最终让苹果澄清，是的，<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230215134419/https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/24/icloud-on-the-web/">会有iCloud的网络应用</a>。不过，还不清楚它们会有多强劲，或者在“今年秋天”之后何时上市。今天，我们得到了更多的答案。</p>
<p class="translated">iCloud.com刚刚上线。这似乎是一个很好的迹象，表明web组件将在未来几个月的某个时候与iCloud一起推出。如果登录界面有任何暗示的话，网络应用将会非常漂亮。</p>
<p class="translated">但实际上，我们不必仅仅依赖登录屏幕，因为虽然这可能意味着开发者可以进行测试(只有他们可以使用iOS 5中的iOS同步功能)，但实际上，任何人都可以登录并查看iCloud.com应用程序的外观。还是很漂亮。</p>
<p class="translated">这并不奇怪。苹果的优势之一一直是审美。但是同样好的是这些应用程序的功能有多灵活。在Safari和Chrome中，所有的应用都感觉反应灵敏，并具有许多微妙的过渡触摸，可能使用了HTML5。</p>
<p class="translated">除了iCloud.com上线，苹果还发布了更多关于iCloud定价的信息。“5GB的免费存储空间对大多数人来说已经足够了。但如果你需要额外的空间，你可以随时购买额外的存储空间，”苹果在网站上写道。这些价格是:</p>
<ul>
<li class="translated">10gb附加空间，每年20美元</li>
<li class="translated">20 GB的额外空间，每年40美元</li>
<li class="translated">以每年100美元的价格额外增加50 GB</li>
</ul>
<p class="translated">请注意，您从iTunes/App Store购买的iCloud照片流、iOS应用程序、音乐和电视节目不计入您的5GB免费存储空间。</p>
