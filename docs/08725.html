				<p id="speakable-summary" class="translated">日本配件制造商<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204095323/http://www.elecom.co.jp/global/"> Elecom </a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204095323/http://www2.elecom.co.jp/peripheral/mouse/m-ne5dl/index.asp">今天发布了</a>【JP】<em>kanden chi</em>，一款设计像电池的无线鼠标。这款2.4GHz的设备是与东京设计公司<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204095323/http://www.nendo.jp/en/"> nendo </a>合作开发的，可以通过USB连接到你的电脑。</p>
<p class="translated">从技术上来说，kandenchi实际上是一个传统的三键鼠标，兼容Windows XP/Vista/7和Mac OS X 10.5及更高版本。</p>
<p class="translated">下面是买家使用鼠标的方式(Elecom只使用宣传图片，显示人们用右手拿着鼠标，但我想这对左撇子也适用):</p>

<p class="translated">Elecom计划10月份开始在日本销售kandenchi，售价65美元。如果你感兴趣，但住在日本以外，可以问问专门的在线商店，比如<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204095323/http://www.geekstuff4u.com/"> Geek Stuff 4 U </a>。</p>
